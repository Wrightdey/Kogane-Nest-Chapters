        <h3>
           After the job was finished and The Chinese was eaten, Hello went back to his glorious home… A one bedroom Apartment. It’s unusual for someone with millions of dollars in wealth to be living in a one bedroom but Hello liked it. Nice and Simple. A living room into a kitchen/dining room area, into a hallway with a medium sized bedroom on the left side and a bathroom on the right. He was essentially living like a college student with the exact opposite financial situation of one.<br><br>

            He was gonna go to sleep but he wanted to check the Job Request System first. To see if his mission was officially ruled complete. The Job request system was like any Job system. Once you get a sorcerer’s license, you can access a website that tells you what Jobs need a sorcerer to complete it. Sometimes it was tracking curse users, other times it was tracking down criminals that the police couldn’t quite catch. The pay varied based on perceived difficulty. Powerful sorcerers could get higher paid Jobs. Being a Special Grade meant getting specific Job requests as well. 
            The curse user Hello fought tonight was one such request. John Werry was too powerful for the average Grade 1, so they decided to make the mission special grade only.<br><br>

            Once Hello saw his Job was complete he went to sleep content and, at least he thought, relaxed. His mind seemed to not think so because his dreams were anything but.<br><br>

            He dreamt of his parents. He remembered them clearly. They were loving, his mother in particular. He watched as they played with them and cooked for them and scolded them. “Them” Being Hello and his Brothers. Hello and his triplets. It was a nice time. Then they went to Hello’s Mother’s sister's house. His Aunt was dead but his Mother had wanted to take care of her family: Her husband and Son. Today was her son’s seventh birthday and Hello’s mother and father wanted to celebrate it with them. My brothers and I were about 8. They went over there and the triplets immediately started playing with their cousin KT. That wasn’t his official name but it was what they called him. It was short for King_T, his Username in the games they played together. They called him that because they didn't know his actual name.<br><br>

            When they met up, Hello first noticed several bruises on him. Black eye, busted lip, and dry tear marks that indicated crying. Hello thought about asking him about it but before that they needed to give him a letter. A letter from his mother. His mother had died from his birth and left him a letter for his seventh birthday. She also left him a winter blue necklace. He read through the letter and started crying,  hugging the triplets’ mother and father, while he gripped his necklace. As he did though, Hello’s parents noticed the bruises on his face and asked him about it. KT was silent but I had my suspicions. Even as a child, Hello could smell the alcohol from outside KT’s home. Hello’s parents shared a look and told us they would talk to KT’s father.<br><br>

            They heard yelling from where the adults were talking. Something about how the triplets’ parents thought King_T shouldn’t be treated like that but it wasn’t their business since he wasn’t their parents’ child. It was escalating and Hello, His brothers, and KT were getting a bit anxious.<br><br>

            “Should we go in,” Darkclaw, Hello’s second oldest, said. “They told us to stay out,” Hello responded but Hello himself was getting pretty anxious too. Lime, Hello’s oldest brother, was getting impatient though “I’m gonna go in soon,” He said. KT, However, wasn’t gonna have that, whether it was due to his own impatience or guilt in knowing this was about him, he yelled “No I’m gonna go in” and ran in himself.<br><br>

            Hello doesn’t really know the rest. There was a loud smack, yelling from KT and all parties and another smack, and suddenly an explosion. Hello and his brothers barely reacted in time before they were blown away. Lime took most of it but they were all blown several feet away and knocked nearly unconscious. Hello picked himself up there was ringing in his ears and he turned to darkclaw who looked like he going through the same thing. Lime somehow recovered first “We need to get inside! We need to see if they’re alright!” He shouted<br><br>

            Hello wasn’t sure how to tell him that they were most definitely not alright but he could… sense at least one of them being alive. “OK!” Hello and Darkclaw said together and went inside. How a bunch of kids thought of going inside a live fire is beyond Hello but he supposed that was their sorcerer instincts kicking in early. They went inside. The fire was oppressive on every one of Hello’s senses. He heard Darkclaw coughing behind him so he assumed his brothers were dealing with similar issues but Lime seemed unaffected. Lime was walking through the fire with a nonchalance that you would have walking down the street. Before Hello could fully question it though he saw the bodies<br><br>

            All three triplets gasped at the sight of them. Three completely burnt dead bodies. All three with horror written on their faces. Darkclaw looked on with tears forming in his eyes. Hello was about a second or two from falling to knees in despair and lime looked the same before he yelped and pointed towards a gap in the fire, a crying boy. Lime ran over to him and found KT. He was frozen, tear streaks running down his face. But he was fine. He was healing himself somehow but I didn’t know and Hello’s brain stopped questioning things at this point. “Let’s get him up,” Darkclaw said. So we did. We dragged him out, Lime leading because the fire wasn’t affecting him. Actually it was more than that. The fire was both drawn to him and seemed to answer him when he told it to go away, it did. And when he didn’t, the fire went towards him.<br><br>

            Hello and Darkclaw were more affected but definitely not as affected as you’d expect two 8 year olds in a burning building to be. They weren’t unaffected but they were protected. Hello realizes they were subconsciously using CE reinforcement to protect themselves. Lime’s case was definitely more than that though.<br><br>

            They brought KT out and the adrenaline seemed to leave all of them all at once as they fell to the ground. Next thing they knew, they were all in hospitals. The Police asked them to explain what happened. KT couldn’t. Like literally could not get words out. Hello covered for him though. He told the police that they had all been outside at the time of the explosion. Lime and Darkclaw looked at him curiously but Hello knew that if he said KT was inside, that would make the questioning worse and raise suspicion on him. KT looked worse for wear. He was gripping his necklace with both hands like his life depended on it. The police eventually let us go after some more questioning.<br><br>

            “So… What actually happened?” Lime asked, question directed at KT. KT catching his breath started an answer, grabbing his necklace again as he spoke, “I… I don’t know. One moment they were arguing and the next my father tried to hit me and then an explosion… I” KT choked. Lime grimaced. He had been in decent control of his emotions this whole time but that was falling apart. They all had when Hello thought about it. Hello let out a sigh.<br><br>

            “Did your Dad do something?” Darkclaw asked. KT looked down. “Probably” He responded.<br><br>

            Hello thought this through… “Was there any active fire?” Hello questioned. KT thought about it, “Maybe on the stove?” That caused Hello to think. KT’s father was definitely a drunk, he could tell from the stench coming from that house. “Did he try to hit you with an alcohol bottle?” Hello asked. That caused Lime to look up. KT responded. “I think… I don’t know… it was all a blur” Hello looked at KT but it seemed like KT was hiding something. But Hello didn’t… didn’t want to question it. Especially looking at his brother’s faces, desperate for an explanation. Hello wanted to give it to them. “The alcohol caused an explosion. Alcohol and fire… it makes sense” Hello said. Hello was a pretty smart kid for his age. Lime and Darkclaw seemed satisfied with that explanation as they started to properly grieve and start crying. KT was also crying already and Hello tried not to sob but failed miserably.<br><br> 

            The hospital let them go but separated the triplets from KT, despite their protest. KT was God knows where and Hello didn’t think he’d see him again. Hello and his triplets were sent to an orphanage and refused to be adopted unless it was the 3 of them.<br><br>

            2 years passed. Normal Years. Well as normal as it could be for 3 would be sorcerers. We discovered our powers in the orphanage. Lime’s fire abilities especially since, looking back, his abilities were more simple than me and Darkclaw’s. It took them  more time to figure theirs out, in comparison. Or maybe Lime didn’t completely figure his out. It seemed more complex that simple fire abilities. Hello had developed an eye for those types of things. Plus if it was simple Hello would have copied it, even back then.<br><br>

            In between Graduating High school and Getting his sorcerers’ license, Hello would end up with a teacher. Truthfully speaking, he had already been getting teaching from this person in high school and they were the reason he was going for a sorcerer’s license early.<br><br>


            The teacher in question was a strange person, with freak-of-nature-like physical ability and stunning jujutsu knowledge, who also happened to be a special grade sorcerer.<br><br>

            Then there was the 5 years he spent in the lab, before meeting his teacher . That was possibly, definitely the most influential period of his life though he’d developed a skill not to dream about it. He couldn’t allow that man to become a nightmare.<br><br>

            So after years of training (getting his ass kicked) and taking the test, mental and physical, and somehow meeting his cousin KT at said test (KT didn’t recognize him though funnily enough), he was decided as special grade and left off from there.<br><br>

            His dream somehow went back to his parents more, the dinner where his mom would cook pasta, but then he noticed that, for whatever reason, there was tin foil in the microwave. Before Hello could do anything, the microwave exploded, leading to chain explosions, blowing up all his family. He tried to grab his brothers but the explosion got them to. Before it could reach him however, his eyes opened. He was awake.<br><br>

            “God..” Hello grumbled in bed “I hate sorcerer dreams”.<br><br>
