    <div id="content">
        Hello is his name. Code namename.. Due to the dangers of being a public sorcerer, codenames were rather common. So Hello was Hello.The special grade who, allegedly, barely spoke. The special grade went MIssion after MIssion. Check after Check. Meal after Meal. It was how he lived. It was a life he preferred. A life of, what he considered, relaxation.<br><br>

        This was another mission. Hunting down a Curse User that had been causing far too much trouble to be left alone.<br><br>

        His name was John Werry. He committed a bank robbery resulting in 50 people dead, 30 people injured, and 200,000 dollars stolen.  The mission had gone up immediately and as usual, Hello got to the mission just as quickly.<br><br>

        <i>So much money stolen</i> Hello thought as he jumped from building to building,, <i>But you could've made more by just being a sorcerer.</i> It was strange for a curse user of this caliber to steal money but also not uncommon. Some people just<br><br>

        John was currently jumping on the rooftops with Hello hot on his heels. Hello thought of picking up the pace as he usually liked to be done early but he sensed something wrong and kept a distance. He saw he was right as John suddenly stopped and a knife(?) swiped right below Hello’s Chin with perfect form.<br><br>

        Hello was able to dodge just in time before his throat could be cut open. <i>Was that a knife? No I don’t think so</i>. Hello thought<br><br>

        John waved his right hand in a circle and Hello felt himself get blown by a wind gust. <i>Ah so it wasn’t an actual knife</i>, Hello thought, <i>but wind</i>. Hello would strengthen his cursed energy and hold his ground and start pushing through. John looked surprised an  used his left hand to  intensify it however Hello used one of his techniques, <i>Acceleration</i> along with Cursed energy enhancements to push through and land a right in his gut. John spit out blood and waved his hand again but Hello wouldn’t let him get that technique off again. While they were still close, Hello grabbed the front of his collar with his left hand and used an Electric Shock in his right to fully shock him.<br><br>

        He let go of his collar and pulled Werry’s head up and made eye contact with him but before Hello could fully knock him out, Werry Threw his arms up for a big air tornado. Hello managed to react in time though and used <i>Acceleration</i> once again to back away from him<br><br>

        Werry looked at him suspiciously. “That sudden movement… and electricity… You have two cursed techniques?”<br><br>
        
        Hello didn’t respond but started moving his arms in a certain motion. The exact same as Werry’s. Werry’s Eyes widened at the sight.<br><br>

        
        Hello's technique was <i>Copy</i>.<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The <i>Acceleration was something he gained from the first Curse User he ever fought</i></li><br>
            <li>The electricity was an <i>aspect</i> of the <i>Mythical Beast Amber</i> which he got from one of his close friends <i>Africa</i>.</li><br>
            <li><i>This technique with his Incredible Amount of Cursed energy and control. As well as Reverse Cursed Technique and Domain, things typical of a special grade, as well as mastered simple domain is why he’s the one of the highest paid special grade sorcerers in the world. That and his consistency for this kind of work.</i></li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        He copies the technique of anyone he makes eye contact with and sees the technique of. However, he must understand the technique. In and Out.  He saw Werry’s wind and made eye contact with him after the shock. And the technique is actually a very simple one so it was easy to understand.<br><br>

        Werry looked on in horror as Hello began to use his technique. Werry couldn’t counter as he used all of his cursed energy for that last blast of wind. Hello decided to add the electricity to the wind and made a small tornado storm and blasted Werry with it. He tried to block but ended up being sent flying off the building and into the street.<br><br>

        Hello Looked to see he was fully unconscious. After confirming that, he jumped down to pick him up and would go to bring him in. <i>Another Mission Down. Maybe I’ll get Chinese After this.</i>
