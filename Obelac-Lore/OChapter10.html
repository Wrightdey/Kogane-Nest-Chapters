        <h1>Chapter Ten: The Road You Showed Me Broadened My Horizon</h1><br>
        <h2><i>Interlude
                <br>
                -Lionel-</i>
        </h2><br>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
        Lionel looked up at his mother. He saw just how nervous she was and could hear her heart beating in her chest.
        Once he heard Obelac, Demon, and Chinatsu get a distance away, he would lean against a tree and let out a deep
        sigh. “Ah…finally they’re gone…”
        <br><br>
        “Lionel?” Brunestud asked, looking down at him. She outstretched her hand and placed it gently on her son’s
        shoulder. “Are you alright?”
        <br><br>
        “I am, I am,” he assured. “It’s just…keeping such a proud face for the others took a lot out of me.” He gave her
        a wry smile as he looked up at her. “Five hundred years…such a long time, isn’t it?”
        <br><br>
        “It is…” she said.
        <br><br>
        “May I admit something to you?”
        <br><br>
        “Of course.”
        <br><br>
        “For a small while, I was jealous,” he told her. “Of Obelac. Earlier we talked and I told him what I had
        initially thought of him when I first saw him. I told him I resented him, that I thought he was your attempt at
        trying again. At replacing me. And now I admittedly still have that twinge of jealousy. But that has been
        overridden by something else entirely”
        <br><br>
        He took a moment to make a veil around them to conceal themselves from any potential ears or eyes, then
        continued. “I’m tired, mother,” he told her. “I’m not as strong as you, my Cursed Energy isn’t as immense as
        yours, my strength and endurance isn’t as great, and my techniques aren’t as advanced. I’ve peaked at my
        strength, but it’s not enough. I am only a single man, after all.”
        <br><br>
        “Lionel…” Brunestud began. “You are more than capable. Though I have not seen your current strength, I have no
        doubt you are as strong as you need to be. You’ve kept everything together in my absence for half a millennium.
        Anyone else would see themselves failing. But you have persisted.”
        <br><br>
        “I have,” he agreed. “And yet I had to do so many things to even approach the strength you possessed back then.
        Do you know how Cursed Spirits taste, mother?”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud shook her head. “No…I don’t.”
        <br><br>
        “They taste abhorrent,” he chuckled. “Like a dirty rag used to wipe up vomit. After five hundred years and
        twenty million curses absorbed, it becomes an annoyance to deal with it.”
        <br><br>
        “Then I take it you made a binding vow with yourself to ease the burden?”
        <br><br>
        “I did. I made a binding vow that in order for me to lose my sense of taste, my sense of hearing would
        increase.”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud sighed as she heard his words. “You’ve suffered so much…” she said softly. “You won’t have to carry
        this burden anymore. Not with me here. I promise I’ll pull my weight as I should have.”
        <br><br>
        Lionel smiled at that. “Thank you, mother. I need your help, I truly do. I must confess, I have plans that
        require your help.”
        <br><br>
        “And what are these plans?”
        <br><br>
        “I want to expand our territory, our influence,” he told her. “I want to create a dynasty that will last more
        than a measly two thousand years. I want a kingdom for our people. A true kingdom. And to do that I’ll need
        someone who can contend with and possibly deter the Church and the Monster Hunters. I could handle most of the
        Church on my own, but the Monster Hunter’s vampire slayer is more than troublesome. I intend on trying to find a
        way to circumvent an altercation with them altogether, though if I can’t, I will need your assistance should
        they try to retaliate fully.”
        <br><br>
        “How ambitious,” Brunestud said as she smiled. “If it is your wish, I will support you.”
        <br><br>
        “I know you will, mother,” he said. “I need it, now more than ever. I need you to guide us as you used to all
        those years ago.”
        <br><br>
        “I shall,” she said. “It is the least I can do. I swear I shall…I swear it on my life and the memory of your
        father, the man I loved.”
        <br><br>
        “Thank you, mother,” he said. “Now, I take it you need to be familiarized with this place?”
        <br><br>
        “I do, yes. I wish to meet all those Kindred I’ve never seen before as well.”
        <br><br>

        <div id="header">
            <i>Interlude<br>
                -The Moonlight Lords-</i>
        </div>

        <br><br>

        Glaston Locke-Sharlin was the second eldest vampire behind Lionel. In fact, Lionel was the one who sired him.
        Glaston wore a black tuxedo and had his white hair combed back. He and the rest of the Moonlight Lords were
        having an impromptu meeting at the revelation that just came upon them. Brunestud had returned. Some of the
        Lords had never seen her before, such as Hong Lu, Laura Greene, and Hayami Watanabe.
        <br><br>
        Glaston sighed as he sat down and glanced across his allies. “...this is a momentous time,” he said finally.
        “The Great Progenitor has returned to us after all this time…”
        <br><br>
        “Indeed,” said another, Laeticia Jaynelle. She looked to be in her mid forties and had a blonde ponytail draped
        over her shoulder and piercing red eyes. She wore a flowing black and gold dress as she sat with her legs
        crossed. “After five centuries she has indeed returned, yet what does that mean for us? For our kind as a
        whole?”
        <br><br>
        “It means we have our Progenitor to guide us,” Glaston said. “To help us and allow us to increase our standing.”
        <br><br>
        “Is that all,” Laeticia asked. “I do not believe that to be the case. You saw what Obelac did, did you not? He
        struck her. Surely we’ll have to punish him for that.”
        <br><br>
        “And what do you suggest we do,” asked Glaston.
        <br><br>
        “You know,” she insisted. Glaston narrowed his eyes, and another would speak.
        <br><br>
        “You never did like him, did you?” Hayami asked. Hayami was Japanese, specifically descended from the Zenin
        clan. She had short black hair in a bob cut and red circular glasses. She wore a black jacket and black jeans,
        and looked over at Laeticia. “You never held back on voicing your disdain for him ever since you first saw him.”
        <br><br>
        “Because he was weak, inexperienced, and only among us because of his status as a First Kindred,” Laeticia
        retorted. “He is twenty one years old, and only knows of killing Curses.
        Nothing more. He knows nothing about governing or politics or anything of the sort.”
        <br><br>
        “But he is still a first Kindred,” Hayami said. “Higher up the Bloodstream than you or I. The second of his kind
        to be alive in the current age. If he were to be stripped of his rank due to what he did, who would replace
        him?”
        <br><br>
        “We do not need a tenth,” Laeticia said. “We have done fine with just us nine before him, and we would continue
        on well without.”
        <br><br>
        “That decision is for us to make as a whole,” Glaston insisted. “Until then, there will be no talk until Lionel
        is here to speak his mind.”
        <br><br>
        “You know he will support Obelac,’ Laeticia said. “He is the reason he’s a part of us to begin with.”
        <br><br>
        “You’re right,” Glaston said. “And I trust his decisions more than I trust yours.”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia narrowed her eyes at that. “I beg your finest pardon,” she growled. “Need I remind you who we were
        before we became Kindred? You were naught but a simple peasant. I was a Queen.”
        <br><br>
        “A Queen who’s kingdom was destroyed and conquered,” Glaston retorted. “Your past is as irrelevant as mine.”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia rose up in her seat, only to feel a hand on her shoulder. She turned around and saw Hong Lu’s hand on
        her. He was a tall Chinese man with long black hair tied in a single braid and jade green eyes. He wore a red
        changshang with black flower details. An ever present smile was on his face as he looked at her. “Now, let’s not
        fight,” he said softly. “It’s not our place to do so, in these halls or in general. If the head fights among
        itself, how can the rest of the body survive?”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia slowly sat back down and let out a heavy sigh. “Very well. That was unbecoming of me, I admit. However
        my point still stands. Obelac struck the Great Progenitor, even if she didn't take offense to it, there must
        still be punishments for breaking our edicts. It is the law, and no one should be exempt from that.”
        <br><br>
        “I agree with that,” Hong Lu said as he returned to his seat. “But that is best discussed with everyone else,
        isn’t it? For now…we have to figure out how to catch Brunestud up with everything that has happened.”
        <br><br>
        “Indeed…” Glaston sighed as he folded his hands together. Laeticia continued sitting where she was and kept her
        own thoughts to herself as the rest of the Lords began to converse. The rules needed to be followed regardless
        of who broke them, that was something she believed vehemently, and she also believed that the Vampires deserved
        far more of the world than what they had currently.
        <br><br>
        The Church, the Monster Hunters, all of those who opposed them in the past had to be dealt with, and with the
        return of the Great Progenitor, such a time was upon them.<br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>

        Chinatsu and Obelac had returned to the former’s home. Obelac sighed as he slumped down on Chinatsu’s couch he
        felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him. Chinatsu sat down beside him, and Obelac’s mind fully began to
        acknowledge just what exactly had happened.
        <br><br>
        His mother had returned. She loved him. She apologized to him. She wanted to be with him again.
        <br><br>
        *Mom came back.*
        <br><br>
        Obelac slumped down into the couch as he found his breaths had grown more labored, and soon after that he felt
        his eyes sting. He felt a hand on his shoulder and felt Chinatsu pull him close to her.
        <br><br>
        “How are you holding up,” she asked him. Her voice was full of concern, and he’d close his eyes as he leaned
        into her.
        <br><br>
        “Decent, I think,” he said. “It was…a lot, really. I think I’m still processing everything that happened…”
        <br><br>
        He took a moment to collect his thoughts, before he suddenly blurted out, “...I hit her…”
        “...you did,” Chinatsu confirmed.
        <br><br>
        “...I-”
        <br><br>
        “-she didn’t seem to hold it against you,” she told him. “She loves you, after all. I don’t think that mattered
        at all to her.”
        <br><br>
        “No, you…you don’t get it,” he said. “Well, you do, it’s just…I also broke the rules when I did that.”
        <br><br>
        “You were in a severely emotional state when you did,” she said. “I’m not…I don’t wanna say if she deserved it
        or not, that’s not my place. I can’t tell you how you should feel, but what I can tell you is that you didn’t
        seem to hurt her, and she didn’t seem to care about it anyway. She still hugged you, after all. Promised
        everything to you.”
        <br><br>
        “That doesn’t matter…” he said. “I…there’s laws and stuff I’m expected to uphold,” he told her. “As a first
        Kindred and a part of the Moonlight Lords. I’m expected to behave in a certain manner, and one of those things
        is Filial Piety…and I just hit my mother, the progenitor of our species.”
        <br><br>
        “I’m sure Lionel will be understanding,” she assured him. “He seems like a good guy.”
        <br><br>
        “It’s not just him that I’ll have to worry about,” Obelac told her. “The others don’t like me, especially
        Laeticia. She hates me, I’m sure. She always did.”
        <br><br>
        “What’s she like?”
        <br><br>
        “Proud. Uptight, a stickler for the rules. She wants everything done by the book and I doubt she’ll be alright
        with what I did, even if it can be excused, even if Mom herself doesn’t care at all that it happened.”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu was about to say something, but swallowed her words. Instead she looked Obelac in the eye. “Whatever
        happens, I’m sure you’ll be fine,” she assured him. “I don’t think anything bad will happen to you.”
        <br><br>
        “Other than getting kicked from my position, yeah. Nothing bad,” he said with more scorn than he intended.
        <br><br>
        “Since when did you care about having it,” she asked him. Obelac stared in silence at her for a moment before he
        looked away.
        <br><br>
        “I don’t know,” he admitted. “I…it’s…it was…I guess because I was…acknowleged that way? I know me being a First
        Kindred is the only reason I’m a part of it, but I guess I didn’t mind being a part was because I was still…a
        part of something? Or maybe because it meant people could, or had to accept me and my existence. Like…like how I
        thought mom didn’t.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac placed his face in his hands as he bent forward. He steadied his breathing as he tried to collect
        himself. He leaned back and freed his face. “I thought she hated me, and me being a Lord was acknowledgment that
        I still existed despite how she may have felt.”
        <br><br>
        “But she doesn’t hate you,” she said.
        <br><br>
        “She doesn’t,” he acknowledged. “I…I can guess that I won’t be made to leave. If not from Lionel then mom
        herself. If she wants me to stay, then I’ll stay. Her word is above everyone’s.”
        <br><br>
        “So, she’s your queen, then?” she asked. “I heard that Lionel was considered the king of Vampires as a whole.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac shook his head. “She’s far more,” he told her. “She’s like our god…no, she is our god. She’s like…what
        Gaea is to Greek mythology or Tiamat to Mesopotamian myth. She’s the architect for our two thousand years of
        existence. She was birthed from the same…whatever that made humans and dragons and werewolves and everything
        else.”
        <br><br>
        “A god, huh…” Chinatsu repeated.
        <br><br>
        He sighed. “...I still can’t believe she’s really back,” he said. “It was only three years, but if felt so much
        fucking longer than that. All that time I spent starving, resenting her…that was only three years but it felt
        like it was forever…” Obelac looked down at the floor. “...I don’t even know if I should really forgive her…”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu sighed. “I…can’t really say if you should or shouldn’t,” she told him. “But do you want to?”
        <br><br>
        He only nodded in response. Obelac kept his gaze on the ground. “How do…what do I do now? With mom?”
        <br><br>
        “I don’t know,” she admitted. “Whatever you’ve always wanted to do?”
        <br><br>
        “Maybe…” he said in response. Obelac stayed in silence for a moment before he spoke again. “Chinatsu, is
        there…is there anything you need me to do for you?”
        <br><br>
        She turned to him in confusion. “No. Why?”
        “It’s…it’s not fair for you to sit here and listen to all this…all of my problems-”
        <br><br>
        “-it doesn’t matter if it’s fair or not, I’d be wrong if I didn’t,” she retorted. “I want to help you, Obelac.
        And if I need to get something off my chest or ask for advice, I know you’re more than willing to help.”
        <br><br>
        He nodded at that. “Sorry…”
        <br><br>
        “You don’t need to apologize,” she said. “Obby, look at me.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac did as such. He turned to Chinatsu and looked at her. She placed a hand on his shoulder. “You don’t need
        to feel guilty about me wanting to help.”
        <br><br>
        “I know…it’s just…I dunno,” he said. “Fuck..I…I just…wanna be there for you, ya know? Like how you’re there for
        me and how others are there for people they love. I…just wanna be there for someone.”
        <br><br>
        “You will be,” she assured him. “I know you’ll be there when I need you.”
        <br><br>
        He nodded and took a moment to wipe some fledgling tears from his eye.
        <br><br>
        “Now, let’s get some pizza or something,” she said. “You need to wind down, yeah?”
        “I do.”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu moved to get her phone and Obelac closed his eyes. His mind was still racing with raw emotions, but he
        had a focus. Despite the conflicting things he felt about his mother, he knew he loved her. Beyond all the other
        complicated emotions, he loved her. He wanted to be with her and to stay by her side as he always wished. He
        wanted to help her, his mother, the woman who saved his life, his hero.
        <br><br>
        It was at that moment he fully realized why he asked Chinatsu that. He wanted to be someone's Hero, to repay the
        kindness Brunestud, Demon, Chinsatsu, Lionel, and Dane showed him. A smile formed on his lips as he recalled
        moments he had with them, and as Chinatsu ordered their pizza he felt as if a weight on his heart had been
        lifted.
