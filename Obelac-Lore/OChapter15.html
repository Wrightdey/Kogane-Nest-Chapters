        <h1>Chapter Fifteen: It's So Much Fun Leaving Reality Behind</h1><br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
        Obelac gasped for air as he looked across at Laeticia. The woman was wearing a black tank top and black
        sweatpants and a pair of white running shoes. Her hair was tied in a bun, and she looked down at him as he was
        bent over.
        <br><br>
        “I didn’t say you could rest,” she chastised. “Get up, Obelac.”
        <br><br>
        He groaned as he stood up straight. Laeticia was fairly muscular, though not at the level that Chinatsu was.
        Obelac wore a pair of black sweatpants, a black t-shirt, and black running shoes. He looked across at the
        Kindred and rolled his eyes.
        <br><br>
        Obelac’s Cursed Energy flared, and in his hand formed a small orb of pale moonlight. The Moon Manipulation
        Cursed Technique had three main applications. The Lapse: the Light Side of the moon bestowed upon its user the
        ability to reflect physical inertia. The Reversal: Dark Side of the Moon gave the ability to manifest darkness
        and the capability to change its shape and form and solidify it. The combination, the Hollow Technique,
        replicated the moon to the size its caster could produce.
        <br><br>
        The orb of pale moonlight in Obelac’s hand would turn pitch black, and its form would slowly morph into that of
        a sheathed katana. Laeticia looked across at the First Kindred and manifested a rapier made of dark-moonlight.
        She narrowed her eyes as she got in position, her blade pointed at Obelac. Her other arm was behind her back and
        one foot was in front of the other-a typical fencing position.
        <br><br>
        A second would pass, and the two dark-moon blades clashed. Laeticia’s blade was cleaved through as Obelac
        performed his Heavenly Strike. The Second Kindred’s eyes widened at the sheer speed behind his attack, and he
        used that time to get another attack off and slashed at her side.
        <br><br>
        Obelac was used to Dane’s annoying teleportation technique whenever he trained with swordsmanship, and though
        Laeticia was faster, she was not faster than light. As he watched her wounds heal, Laeticia would narrow her
        eyes.
        <br><br>
        “So, then you’re not as incompetent as you seem,” she said.
        <br><br>
        “You’re just mad I got a hit off.”
        <br><br>
        Right at those words left Obelac’s mouth, Laeticia leapt forward and slammed her fist in Obelac’s stomach. He
        grit his teeth, only to then retaliate by slamming his forehead against hers. She held on, and kneed Obelac in
        the stomach, and a split second later she roundhouse kicked him straight into a wall. Obelac crashed into it,
        his eyes wide as the wall cracked. However in a split second he was back on his feet. The two traded punches,
        their muscles flexing as the ground beneath them gained deep scars.
        <br><br>
        A split second of difference was all it took for Obelac to swing a right hook into Laeticia’s face. That split
        second of opportunity that he saw, that his opponent didn’t see, was all it took as he sent her flying into the
        ceiling. Obelac took a moment to catch his breath as he saw Laeticia slowly descend to the ground. She cracked
        her neck as her wounds quickly healed. “Right then…” she began. “Not all that bad.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac rolled his eyes. “Yeah yeah, whatever…”
        <br><br>
        “Stand up straight, steady breathes,” she chastised.
        <br><br>
        “You’re not my fucking mo-”
        <br><br>
        Obelac was then punched onto the ground as Laeticia slammed her fist into his cheek. His neck made an odd sound
        as he crashed into the floor.
        <br><br>
        “Get up,” she ordered, her arms folded. Obelac slowly rose to his feet.
        <br><br>
        “Fuck you.”
        <br><br>
        “More crude language and you’ll return right back to the ground.”
        <br><br>
        He rolled his eyes. “Whatever…”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia rolled her shoulders. “When you’re adept at utilizing your Cursed Technique, you will need to form your
        own Maximum Techniques,” she said.
        <br><br>
        “...so…” Obeac began.
        <br><br>
        “So?”
        <br><br>
        “I…kinda already did that.”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia stared blankly at Obelac. “...elaborate.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac took a deep breath as he closed his eyes. “<i>Six petals. Five Timeless Words. Maximum Technique: Rho
            Aias.</i>”
        <br><br>
        As he outstretched his hand and opened his palm, a six petal pale flower sprouted from Obelac’s hand. Laeticia
        looked it over and flicked it. The force was sent back to her and made her clothes rustle a little. “I
        see…acceptable.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac rolled his eyes at that. “Acceptable?”
        <br><br>
        “You know that’s what I said.”
        <br><br>
        “Can’t you give me any props at all?”
        <br><br>
        “Only when you deserve it. Here, you do not.”
        <br><br>
        He swallowed the urge to swear at her as he flicked his hand and caused the flower-shield to dissipate.
        <br><br>
        “All in all, your progress has been commendable,” she admitted. “Though you have much to improve on, your growth
        is rather noteworthy”
        <br><br>
        “Gee thanks…”
        <br><br>
        “Now. Again,” she said. Seven black orbs appeared behind her, and soon blasted at Obelac. His eyes widened as he
        hastily chanted and performed Rho Aias once more. The shield blocked and reflected the dark-moonlight released
        by Laeticia, who then quickly dodged her own attacks. She rushed forward, and Obelac grit his teeth as he
        performed the same attack. Black orbs of dark-moonlight appeared around Obelac, five to Laeticia’s seven, and he
        took a deep breath.
        <br><br>
        Dark-moonlight was able to have its form change into whatever the user desired, and as Rho Aias dissipated, the
        dark-moonlight orbs would soon morph into five longswords. Obelac launched them at the Second Kindred. She
        batted a few aside, yet as she moved to grab the fourth sword Obelac would manifest a sixth orb from his mouth
        and released a powerful blast at her Laeticia’s eyes widened as the attack blasted her backward. Obelac bolted
        forward, grabbed her outstretched arm, and slammed Laeticia into the floor and caused chunks of debris to fly
        upward.
        <br><br>
        Obelac smiled a little at that. As he stepped back, he’d watch Laeticia get up as her wounds already begun to
        heal. She dusted herself off, then narrowed her eyes. “Wipe that smile off your face.”
        <br><br>
        “What smile?” he asked, grinning. Laeticia appeared in Obelac within the blink of an eye, her hand wide open to
        try to palm his face into the ground. Obelac’s eyes widened at this as he quickly grabbed her wrist and twisted
        her around him to throw her into the air. Laeticia would emit dark-moonlight from the palms of her hands to
        propel herself downward, and flipped forward to slam her leg down at Obelac in a spinning kick. He grit his
        teeth as he blocked with his arms and was sent onto his knees as he struggled. “Shit…”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia’s leg would light up with pale-moonlight, and Obelac’s eyes widened as the force he exerted to push
        back against Laeticia’s leg was used against him. He was sent down onto the ground as a shockwave spread out
        throughout the training room.
        <br><br>
        Laeticia’s momentary victory was short lived as an explosion of dark-moonlight caused her to be launched
        backward, and Obelac was right on her as he grabbed her ankle and used it as an anchor to pull her closer. The
        First Kindred’s fist collided with Laeticia’s face, and a split second after the hit landed he elbowed her
        throat and sent her crashing down onto the ground. As dirt and debris was kicked up, Laeticia reached up and
        wrapped her fingers around Obelac’s throat and choke-slammed him into the ground. A groan of pain left his lips
        as he gripped her arm to try and pull her off, and yet Laeticia didn’t budge. “Submit,” she told him, her eyes
        red with rage.
        <br><br>
        He grit his teeth, but would rather die than submit to her. He didn’t want to give her the satisfaction. Not at
        all. Obelac grit his teeth and lunged forward to headbut Laeticia. She let go of him as she reeled back, and
        he’d kick her off him. Obelac got to his feet as he caught his breath.
        “Ah…fuck…you satisfied yet…?”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia slowly rose up, clearly frustrated as she wiped the dust off her. She looked at Obelac. “...I suppose,”
        she said. “Dismissed. And take a shower. You smell abhorrent.”
        “Yeah well you smell like dogshit too-”
        <br><br>
        Obelac swore at himself as Laeticia took hold of his arm, lifted him over her shoulder, and slammed him back
        into the ground. He heard her footsteps walk off as he laid there.
        “...fuckin asshole…”
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>

        <br>
        The Isle of Lamia had a fishing spot that was quite popular among the younger Kindred. Demon had told Obelac of
        it, and he asked Lionel to head there with them once he was done training with Laeticia. The brothers sat on
        tree stumps as they looked out at the sea beyond them, the moon high in the sky. Lionel wore a black compress
        shirt and a pair of black jeans and black sneakers, a rather modern look that Obelac wasn’t used to him wearing.
        The clothes he wore made Obelac realize Lionel was actually rather built. It made sense to him, since he had
        been fighting for over a thousand years. Lionel held the fishing line as his eyes were closed.
        <br><br>
        “So…” Obelac began. “What was it like during the Golden Age?”
        <br><br>
        “It was…different from what history was told.”
        <br><br>
        “...how?”
        <br><br>
        “What do you know of the Golden Age? Of the legends of that time?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac leaned forward a little. “I know Sadako Gojo,” he said. “A user of the Six Eyes and Limitless.”
        <br><br>
        “Anyone else?”
        <br><br>
        “I know of the Cursed Spirit, Shuten Douji, and her battle against a battalion of Cursed Spirits. I know of King
        Arthur’s reign and him wielding Excalibur.”
        <br><br>
        “And what of mother?”
        <br><br>
        “Mom…she didn’t tell me much,” Obelac admitted. “And I didn’t learn much either. She apparently fought strong
        foes, but who they were wasn’t really elaborated on.”
        <br><br>
        “I see…” he said. “And of the Church?”
        <br><br>
        He shook his head. “Never paid attention to them.”
        <br><br>
        Lionel laughed at that. “Quite fair, quite fair,” he said. “As much as I loathe the church, I am forced to
        interact with them and know their customs.”
        <br><br>
        Lionel pulled out something from his pocket, a handkerchief. On it was a symbol of a crescent moon with a cross
        inside.
        <br><br>
        “That’s your sigil, right?”
        <br><br>
        “It is,” he confirmed. “The Chruch until recently answered only to the Pope. The Pope was and still is viewed as
        the only person who knows God’s wish for the world promised to humans. Their edicts and decrees are made with
        the authority of God himself, and whoever the Pope would sign to death, his faithful would hunt them to the ends
        of the earth.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac watched Lionel place the handkerchief in his lap. “My father, Leandros, was the Pope during the younger
        years of our mother. My birth mother was a bodyguard who he had seduced and later bore me. She was still
        assigned as a bodyguard, yet their desires for each other faded, and she was later killed by a Cursed Spirit. It
        wasn’t until I was thirteen that I met Brunestud. She was younger then, and smaller. She and my father grew
        close and fell in love, and I soon grew to view her as a mother.”
        <br><br>
        “What happened to him?”
        <br><br>
        Lionel sighed. “When I was twenty, when mother had sired me as her Kindred, there was a…threat that we had to
        put down. A dragon, the King of Dragons, Vritra. History may tell you that Sadako Gojo died in childbirth, or
        that Arthur Pendragon was sent to Avalon, but that is a lie perpetuated by Jujutsu Society and Humanity as a
        whole. A lie I have no power nor desire to combat.”
        <br><br>
        “...I have another question,” Obelac admitted. Lionel turned to him as he opened his eyes. “How can you…how can
        older Kindred grow to hate Humans, when they used to be them?”
        <br><br>
        Lionel sighed. “I cannot speak for others, but for me…it’s how foolish they can be,” he said. “Foolishness is a
        trait of every being born of sapeince, and yet Humanity’s sheer numbers and diverse beliefs is what allows them
        to tear themselves apart. I have witnessed wars, genocides, and the collapsing of empires be caused due to human
        hatred and greed. Killing their fellow man for nothing but resources, or skin color, or because they wish to
        enlighten them with their ‘superior culture’. I was a human, yes, but with immortality and a thousand years of
        perspective, there comes wisdom. I do not despise humans, I despise Humanity, little brother. The individual
        human can be a bastion of wisdom and faith and goodness, as much as it could be a bastion of evil, for that is
        free will. Even us Vampires are not immune to the fruits of wrongdoing, but yet we are able to punish those to
        parake in those fruits. Humanity is not. For every human that is properly punished, it would seem that six
        others are not punished in the slightest.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac sighed. “I get that, I do,” he began. “But…what have vampires done to help Humans?”
        <br><br>
        “Our people prefer to keep to ourselves, and our influence in greater Human affairs would be met with hostility
        from Humanity, and so we do our best to take in those that we can. I believe you could ask Laeticia who the
        youngest Kindred she sired is.”
        <br><br>
        “Huh…alright then…” Obelac said. “I…actually think that’s how I feel about Vampires, now that you say that…”
        <br><br>
        “Oh? Elaborate,” Lionel said, curious. Obelac looked out at the sea.
        <br><br>
        “I don’t hate all Vampires. I don’t hate Demon, or you, or mom, or Hong Lu or a few other Vampires, but I hate
        how Vampires can be. I hate how smug and superior Lucius and Laeticia can be, I hate how judgemental some can
        be. I hate how…lesser they can make me. Like despite me being higher in the Bloodstream, I’m still not worth
        shit.”
        <br><br>
        Lionel listened as he reeled in his fish, catching a rather large sturgeon. He looked over it and placed it in
        an ice box. “I see…” he said. “I suppose I’ll have to talk with them about that.”
        “I…don’t think that’ll make anything better.”
        <br><br>
        “How so?”
        <br><br>
        “They probably think I’m entitled…” he said. “That I get everything…and they’re not really wrong either…”
        <br><br>
        “I see…” the Elder Kindred said as he threw his line back into the water. Obelac kept waiting for the fish to
        catch his line, and sighed.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>

        <br>
        Obelac and Chinatsu were in their home as they rested together in their bed. Obelac held her in his arms as he
        nuzzled against her shoulder, a smile on his face. Chinatsu held his hands as she basked in their shared warmth.
        <br><br>
        “Are you hungry,” she asked him.
        <br><br>
        “No,” he said.
        <br><br>
        “I am,” she admitted. “You want some pizza?”
        <br><br>
        “Sure,” he said as he kissed her cheek. A smile formed on Chinatsu’s lips as she turned around in his arms to
        face him.
        <br><br>
        “You sure you’re not hungry?”
        <br><br>
        “You just need an excuse,” he chuckled.
        <br><br>
        “...ok yeah, but you can’t blame me.”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu slowly left his embrace as she sat up on the bed. “Meatlovers?”
        <br><br>
        “Yeah,” he said. “Extra meat.”
        <br><br>
        She chuckled. “Geez…fatty.”
        <br><br>
        “Not my fault meat tastes good.”
        <br><br>
        “Yes it is.”
        <br><br>
        He raised a brow. “...how though?”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu looked at him for a small moment that felt like an eternity before she got onto her feet. Chinatsu wore
        a teddy-pair pajama set and teddy-bear slippers, which Obelac found to be funny, yet cute at the same time. He
        himself only wore a t-shirt and shorts.
        <br><br>
        “Pizza and a movie?” Obelac asked.
        <br><br>
        “We always do that.”
        <br><br>
        “But I like that. Don’t you?”
        <br><br>
        “I do, but it couldn’t help mixing things up, right?”
        <br><br>
        “I guess…”
        <br><br>
        “You got games, right? Could you show me a couple? What’s that one you’ve been playing? Dead Souls?”
        <br><br>
        “Dark Souls.”
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, that.”
        <br><br>
        “Alright…” he said as he slowly got off the bed. “Let me take a sec to boot it up while you order the pizza.
        Also get some root beer too, please.”
        <br><br>
        “You’re addicted to that stuff.”
        <br><br>
        “So? It’s amazing.”
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, yeah,” she said as she headed off to the kitchen. Obelac went into the living room as he started to boot
        up the T.V. and his Playstation. He sat down on the couch and sank down more than he expected.
        <br><br>
        “....wow…” he said, as his mind wandered to the events of a few days ago.
        <br><br>
        “That’s…wow…we really did that…KT was right…oh my god KT was right…”
        <br><br>
        He pushed those thoughts to the back of his mind as he leaned back into the couch. He focused on the game. He
        loaded in and saw that he was still in the Firelink Shrine. He simply waited there until Chinatsu would join
        him.
        <br><br>
        That was until he felt a small, familiar pulse of Cursed Energy from outside. He recognized it to be from the
        messengers of the Higher Ups, and sighed from what was no doubt another assignment. Obelac placed his controller
        to the side as he rose from the couch and went out the front door. He took the note from the mailbox and went
        back inside and slumped down onto the couch. He sighed as he dismissively opened the letter and practically tore
        apart the envelope.
        <br><br>
        He read over it once. Then read over it another time because he thought he made it up. He read the message a
        third time because he felt his eyes were tricking him. He read it a fourth time because he needed time to
        process it. He read it a fifth time because he fully realized what the message had said. And he finally read it
        a sixth time once the weight of those words settled upon him and he felt his mouth dry and his heart pump in his
        chest.

            <div id="header">
                As of yesterday. X,X,20XX, the city of Tokyo was destroyed during a battle between two Special Grade
                Jujutsu Sorcerers. An estimated nine million casualties have been estimated, and no survivors have been
                found as of yet. In addition to this, the Gojo Clan had been entirely eradicated unwarrentedly and
                unjustly.
                <br><br>
                This incident was perpetrated by the Jujutsu Sorcerer known as King T, who possesses the Cursed
                Technique of Heavenly Hands, and was seen wielding a sword that has since been abandoned.
                <br><br>
                Notable fatalities of King T’s senseless assault are as follows.
                <br><br>
                Gojo Jozu
                <br><br>
                Gojo Yura
                <br><br>
                Dane Simonson
                <br><br>
                King T’s liscense as a Jujutsu Sorcerer has hereby been revoked, and he shall be a Curse User with a
                bounty of fifty million USD on his head. Any found associated with him will be considered an enemy of
                Jujutsu Society, and will be exterminated. Tokyo is hereby under surveillance of the Jujutsu Strike
                Force, with Head Sorcerer Ren acting as lead commander. Any unwarranted interference will be met with
                severe hostility.’
