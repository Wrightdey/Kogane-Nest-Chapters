    <div id="content">
        <h3>Obelac was in the cafe as usual, however his routine would be different this time. As he walked up to order
            his daily drink, the barista behind the counter held up her hand. Her name was Chinatsu Hayate, someone he
            had befriended since staying at this town. She was Asian, around his age with a black ponytail and black
            eyes. She wore a white button up with a blue apron, her standard attire for work.</h3>
        <h3>“What?” he asked. Chiharu didn’t say anything, instead forcing a cup of hot tea into his hands.</h3>
        <h3>“It's on the house,” she smiled, winking. “For our loyal customer.”</h3>
        <h3>“Loyal customer,” he repeated. “Yeah. The favortism is nonexistent there.” Chinatsu chuckled, leaning back a
            bit.</h3>
        <h3>“Yup. Loyal customer. By the way, you still free for Saturday? You don’t have work then, do you?”</h3>
        <h3>He shook his head. “I should be good,” he told her, fully knowing there was a 10% chance that would actually
            be the case. “I still have some stuff to attend to today, but I’ll be free after that.”</h3>
        <h3>She nodded, smiling, and he felt his heart quicken at that.</h3>
        <br>
        <hr><br>
        <h3>The Moonlight Lords had rarely gathered, but once they did it was a monumental occasion for not only Vampire
            Kind, but Jujutsu Society. The last time they all attended was to welcome Obelac into their ranks, and
            before that was to sign off the eradication of the oldest Vampire bloodline.</h3>
        <h3>The Ten were not the only one's meeting. Alongside them were representatives from the Church, Kaoru Oda and
            Rodion, and Jujutsu Sorcerers Jussome Nerd and the Higher Up Tadame Zenin. This meeting was called due to
            the rising threat of Cursed Spirits as of late, a threat that the Church was willing to ignore their hatred
            of the ‘heretical’ Vampires.</h3>
        <h3>The Lords were all dressed in various formal wear, with head speaker Demon Akitsuha wearing a black, gothic
            dress. Obelac simply had a tuxedo, one that fit him well, but was still annoying to wear.</h3>
        <h3>“Firstly,” Demon began, her red eyes glancing at the two members of the Church and her fellow Sorcerers,
            “The overall strength of these Special Grades has skyrocketed ever since the creation of a new First
            Kindred.”</h3>
        <h3>Such a thing wasn’t unheard of. Powerful individuals usually heightened the strength of others around them.
            The stronger Sorcerers became, the stronge the Church became, and the stronger Monster Hunters became lead
            to their foes growing in strength as well. Alongside those of the Curse Users, Special Grade Cursed Spirits
            have grown in frequency and strength.</h3>
        <h3>“This has led to a power struggle between our factions, where Sorcerers are being made and killed over and
            over, as for members of the Church. Your soldiers are dying in droves due to this issue-”</h3>
        <h3>“-And yet you Vampires remain unaffected,” Kaoru said, crossing his legs. His tone was stern, rather
            masculine, which stood out from his androgynous build. Obelac felt the difference of their strength just
            from his words. He’d figure he was on the same level as Demon, if not even stronger. The woman beside him
            was a mystery, though he knew she was ranked lower than Kaoru. “You all don’t sacrifice yourselves as we of
            the Church do. And you are partly to blame for this as well.”</h3>
        <h3>“I am a Sorcerer as well,” Demon retorted, rolling her eyes . “I’ve seen my friends die, and I won’t let you
            sit here and act like I haven’t. Now do what your superiors said, and shut up and listen. Love thy neighbor,
            as you people say.”</h3>
        <h3>Kaoru grumbled, before continuing to listen. The woman beside him chuckled.</h3>
        <h3>As Demon continued on, he felt a pair of eyes burning a hole into him. Glancing across the room, he saw Nerd
            sizing him up. Most Sorcerers believed Obelac to be a human, and with Nerd here the jig was up. Obelac knew
            very little about him, but knew that he was a scion of a powerful Jujutsu family, and was slightly ranked
            below him. He was the weakest person in the room, yes, but Obelac was the second weakest. It wasn’t a knock
            against them, but a testament to the inhumanity of the Vampires who shredded theirs long ago, and those who
            became killers in the name of God. The look Nerd gave him was one of someone appraising the worth of a
            precious gem, and Obelac in that moment felt inadequate.</h3>
        <h3>He knew Nerd’s Cursed Technique, something he didn’t have. Yet despite that he was ranked stronger than him.
            Sorcerers are ranked by their base strength, talent, and techniques among other things. The thing that
            separated Obelac from Nerd was his overwhelming physical superiority to any human, due to his status as a
            First Kindred, even as one who never drank blood. He could regenerate without Reverse Curse Technique, and
            his strength, though not as potent as KTs with his Technique and barely scratching the level of Liv’s
            Heavenly Restriction, was still powerful in his base form to surpass those beneath him in their base.</h3>
        <h3>But all of that meant nothing in the case of an overwhelming storm of swords. And yet somehow he was still
            stronger.</h3>
        <h3>Obelac looked to Kaoru and Rodion, the duo complete opposites. While the small man was listening intently,
            even if he was glaring at Demon, Rodion was leaning back in her seat, munching on potato chips. She was a
            giant of a woman, and looked like she could crush a man’s skull with her bare hand, without using Cursed
            Energy. The duality of the ‘Holy’ Church for all these Vampires to be amused by.</h3>
        <h3>“So, there has been a solution,” Demon said, Obelac finally listening to her. “For the sake of the continued
            peace between our factions, we will hold a temporary alliance. Starting soon, the inductees of the Church
            will be trained alongside aspiring Jujutsu Sorcerers. This will be held on Vampire territory as a mediating
            ground.”</h3>
        <h3>"Your territory," Kaoru asked. Demon shook her head.</h3>
        <h3>"I don't own any," she said. "Instead Laura Greene will oversee their training on her territory."</h3>
        <h3>Laura was a Fifth Kindred, one of a lower blood-age than Obelac and Demon, and yet she had the power and
            influence to be the Head of the Division of War.</h3>
        <h3>Obelac zoned out during these talks, mainly being there due to expectation and nothing more. He was too
            young and too weak to have an opinion on this.</h3>
        <h3>Eventually the meeting came to an end, and as he was headed to leave, Nerd came to him.</h3>
        <h3>“What’s up, Vampire,” Nerd said, a sly smirk on his face. Obelac didn’t know why exactly, but he felt a
            shudder of disgust run down his spine the moment he came to talk. He didn’t have any personal quarrels with
            Nerd, but he did know him and his operations to be…the archetypal example of a Higher Up. The Jujutsu
            underworld was kept in check by him, even though he participated.</h3>
        <h3>“None of your business,” he said dismissively, trying to move past him. Nerd blocked his path.</h3>
        <h3>“No, I think it is,” he said, his smirk never fading. “I mean, don’t you think it’s a little odd that
            someone with as much potential as you is just hiding away your status? Your power?”</h3>
        <h3>“Get. Away,” he said, his voice a low growl. Nerd didn’t comply.</h3>
        <h3>“I mean, what? Do you actually care about humans? Why? They’re weaker than you.”</h3>
        <h3>Obelac once more pushed passed him, and this time he relented. As Obelac walked away, Nerd simply called
            out, his tone dripping with sarcasm. “Well, better hope that won’t come back to bite you. That’d be a shame,
            wouldn’t it?”</h3>
        <h3>He didn't even consider the implications of that as he left the room</h3>
