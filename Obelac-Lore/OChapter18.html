        <br><h1>Chapter Eighteen: And Then It Start To Rain</h1><br>

        <br><hr><br>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
        “So…what happened?” Hello asked KT. He looked at the Sorcerer as he steadied his breathing.  
<br><br>
“Dane…was going out of control…” KT said. “He was…killing anyone who came in his way. I tried to stop him…but…he…tried to kill me. He destroyed the city…burnt it down…and I froze it to try and stop the fire from spreading…then…then…” 
<br><br>
Obelac noticed tears starting to form in KT’s eyes.  
<br><br>
“And then?” Hello continued. “What happened then?” 
<br><br>
KT took a moment to collect himself. “I…killed him. Dane. I…had to…he…didn’t give me a choice…he wouldn’t stop…why why wouldn’t he stop?”  
<br><br>
“And Dane’s body?” 
<br><br>
KT didn't answer for a moment. “...Nerd showed up-“  
<br><br>

KT was interrupted by Obelac slamming his fist against a pillar of ice and causing it to shatter into nothingness. “Nerd’s involved?” he asked, his voice filled with anger. “The fuck did that bastard do?”  
<br><br>
KT’s face flooded with tears as he opened his quivering mouth to speak, his eyes red and his voice hoarse. “He…turned Dane into an Eternal Blade…” KT said. “Nearly…killed me…then left…”  
<br><br>
Obelac’s blood ran cold as he bit his lip, blood drawing from it as he began breathing hard. “Fucking-” 
<br><br>
Eternal Blades were akin to Sorcery what nuclear bombs were to normal weapons. The Two Eternal Blades, Excalibur and Kali, were made during the Golden Age and were wielded by legendary heroes. Excalibur by King Arthur and Brunestud, and Kali by Kulani. The sword that KT used to turn Tokyo into ice, and this new one Nerd created, were new anomalies that Obelac wasn’t concerned with at the moment.  
<br><br>
KT had turned Dane into one. He turned another human being into a weapon, for no reason other than whatever bullshit he could justify with. Scum. Complete and utter scum. The manifestation of everything wrong with sentient life.  
<br><br>
Jussom Nerd had turned his closest friend into a weapon. Jussom Nerd had taken his closest friend from him. Jussom Nerd needed to be stopped.  
<br><br>
Jussom Nerd needed to be killed.
<br><br>
He thought back to when they ate at that restaurant, and the burning question of why didn’t he just strangle him to death there and then flooded his mind. The possibilities of his own demise or collateral damage dind’t matter at that moment, only the mental image of his ugly, red, serpentine eyes glazed over like a dead fish and his body riddled with cuts and bruises mattered. Only the image of flies and rats picking over his rotted and worthless corpse mattered.  
<br><br>
His heart beat with fury as the desire for murder welled up inside him. Scum, that was the only word that described Nerd. Or rather, there were far more. Scum, filth, rot, worhtless, useless, the bane of all human good, the idea of greed, a black hole of decency. He was, to Obelac, the most worthless sack of shit to have ever graced the planet. His bones weren’t worth their weight in pigshit, let alone his fortunes.  
<br><br>

Indeed, Obelac knew what he needed to do. Kill Nerd, simple as. He would find him, beat him to death, and parade his corpse across that ugly fucking building he owned and worked in. He’d-
<br><br>
“Calm down, Obelac,” Hello said as he turned to him. “Anger’s not going to do anything.” He then turned to KT. “How did Nerd do that? Even without dying? And what sort of blade was Dane turned into? What abilities did he have? What did the blade look like? Was it longer than normal? What were its properties? Did you clash with your blade?” 
<br><br>
Obelac noticed that Hello’s expression was less concerned and more interested, as if he at that moment cared more about the blade than KT. 
<br><br>
“Fuck what the blade can do,” Obelac said. “We need to get back at Nerd.” 
<br><br>
“Not when he has an Eternal Blade,” Hello said. “We’re not strong enough to fight him with one. We’ll need to have KT use his blade at least to stand a chance.” 
<br><br>
“But-” 
<br><br>
“But nothing. Besides, do you think you can take Nerd on? How much do you know of his abilities?” 
<br><br>
Obelac didn’t say anything. He didn’t want to. To admit he had a point. He just wanted blood. 
<br><br>
“Don’t get yourself killed needlessly, Obelac,” Hello chastised. “It would be a waste.” 
<br><br>
“Fuck off.”
<br><br>
Hello didn’t respond as he lifted KT onto his shoulder and pulled him up. “We have to go, before the Strike Force arrives. If they catch us with him, they’ll kill us all.”
<br><br>
Right as Obelac was about to protest, he felt several powerful Curse Energy signatures at the border of the city. 
<br><br>
“What about Chinatsu?” Obelac asked as he turned to Hello. ”What if they find her? We need to find her first and bring her back!”
<br><br>
“She’s not a Sorcerer,” Hello began. “They don’t have jurisdiction over her. If they don’t know she was here to help KT, she’ll be fine.”
<br><br>
“But-” was all Obelac could manage, before Hello teleported the three out of Tokyo.
<br><br>

                Interlude: Chinatsu Zenin
                <br><br>
                ~The Black Silence~
                <br><br>
            </i>
        </div>

        Chinatsu wandered through the remains of Tokyo atop Nue’s back. She passed Tokyo Jujutsu High, which other than remnants of the main building, was nothing but frozen dust. 
        <br><br>
        Nothing for the most part, at the least. Chinatsu felt a small, miniscule pulse of Cursed Energy, and immediately had Nue fly down in the ruins of Tokyo Jujutsu High. She rushed toward where she felt the signature, and there, buried deep within rubble and frozen snow, was a young man whose body was encased in ice and whose face was the only thing free. He had white hair, pale skin, and black eyes. His name was Byakuya Takamura, one of her classmates.
        <br><br>
        “Kuma!” she screamed out as she hopped off of Nue’s back and ran toward him. “Kuma! Christ, are you alright!?” 
        <br><br>
        Byakuya, or Kuma as she called him, wasn’t even able to nod. As she got closer, Chinatsu noticed that his limbs had turned black, and his face was more pale than it usually would. “Ah…China…” he said, his voice hoarse. He looked like a living corpse, his skin as pale as death and his eyes and hair just as frigid. “I…I’m sorry you gotta see me like…th-”
        <br><br>
        He was unable to finish his sentence without breaking into a coughing fit, his eyes widening in pain as his chest heaved. Saliva and blood was spat out onto the icy ground beneath them as he kept looking at his underclassman. 
        <br><br>
        “Shit! Don’t worry, I’ll get you out there!” Chinatsu said frantically, yet as she stepped toward him, Byakuya shook his head. 
        <br><br>
        “N-no…I-I’m…d-done…” he said, a wry smile on his lips. “China…I’m sorry…you have to see me like this…you shouldn’t have…”
        <br><br>
        “Don’t fucking apologize!” she screamed out. “Just let me think of something! If I can get you outta this ice in one piece I should be able to heal your arms!”
        <br><br>
        “China,” he began, holding back a cough as he looked at her. She couldn’t see his face, not if she wanted to be reminded of the times they spent together. Of him being there for her, helping her, supporting her, not hating her due to her family or her status, or for anything others had hated her for. “Just…go…leave me be…”
        <br><br>
        “Shut the hell up! I’m not letting you fucking die!”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu took a deep breath as shadows began to envelop the ice that encased Byakyua. Her intent was to absorb it into her shadow, and to separate his body from the ice to free him. It was a delicate process, one that she hadn’t done before, but one she absolutely needed to try.
        <br><br> 
        Byakuya didn't say anything as this happened. He was quiet, though in her frantic ploy Chinatsu didn’t notice. She was too focused on her task. She had her shadow absorb the ice up until it reached the part Byakuya was encased inside, taking caution to not accidentally swallow him into her shadow. She focused to make sure she didn’t kill him. Once she was done, and once only his direct body was encased in ice, she lowered him onto his back. “Kuma! It’s alright, I’m almost done!” 
        <br><br>
        He didn’t say anything. 
        <br><br>
        “Kuma, come on, open your eyes!”
        <br><br>
        Nothing. Chinatsu looked down at him. 
        <br><br>
        “Come on! This isn’t the time to play a prank, asshole! Open your eyes!”
        Nothing. 
        <br><br>
        “Kuma! Byakuya! Please! I’ll do anything just open your eyes! Say something! Anything!”
        <br><br>
        Nothing. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu screamed. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu screamed until her voice was sore, she screamed until the entirety of the remains of Tokyo High was engulfed in her shadow, nearly resembling the outer shell of a Domain Expansion. She screamed until she could no more, and then she looked at Byakuya’s body and gave him as best a burial as she could. 
        <br><br>
        She wanted to vomit. She wanted to go back over to where KT was and bash his skull open and have her Divine Dogs pick at his body. She wanted to beat him to even more of a pulp than she already did.
        <br><br>
        The more she thought of it, the more she wanted to do these things, Obelac’s or Hello’s own thoughts be damned. She wanted to kill KT. 
        <br><br>
        She wanted to kill KT. 
        <br><br>
        She wanted to tear his head off. 
        <br><br>
        She wanted to break his spine across her knee. 
        <br><br>
        She wanted to slam his face into the ground until it was a bloody red paste. 
        <br><br>
        She wanted to rip him apart limb from limb and have him remain as a stump of what was once a man. 
        <br><br>
        She wanted to see him crying and begging and cursing his own life.
        <br><br>
        She cried.
        <br><br>
        Her eyes stung. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu hobbled back onto Nue, wanting nothing more than to simply leave. The bird flew. She hung onto it as she kept screaming and crying, her heart beating with a sheer, deep murderous vengeance. 
        <br><br>
        She didn’t care about KT’s story, she didn’t care about what excuses he had, every time she looked at this ocean of ice it only screamed his guilt. His villainy. 
        <br><br>
        She screamed again.
        <br><br>
        She kept screaming until her throat grew too sore and it began to hurt. She screamed and cried until she could no more, and once her strength was sapped, she slumped against Nue’s back. The bird would beat its wings once more as it began to fly away, further from the epicenter of all this calamity. It flew and flew until they reached the edge, where there was no more ice, at the edges of destruction. There was dust and ash beyond the ice’s reach, and soon Chinatsu felt a surge of Cursed Energy rapidly approaching her location. 
        <br><br>
        She assumed it was the Jujutsu Strike Force, since they were the only organization that would have the jurisdiction to operate in Tokyo. Soon enough five Sorcerers appeared, landing in front of Chinatsu. At the head of them was a woman. She was smaller than Chinatsu, standing at what she assumed to be around five feet in height. She had short white hair with black tips, and her eyes had a mixture of white and green to them. She wore more formal attire, a white button up shirt and a red tie, black pants that cut off above the ankle, and a pair of black flats. She had a short, black cape that gave her an aura of superiority. 
        <br><br>
        In contrast, those she surrounded herself by didn’t give that same aura, though they were strong. Chinatsu recalled her brother mentioning the members of the Jujutsu Strike Force with disdain. Mozzane, Africa, Nexus, and Justice were behind their leader, Ren, cursed energy leaking from them as they looked at Chinatsu. It was at that moment she remembered she was still in her pajamas. 
        <br><br>
        “What are you doing here,” Ren asked, her eyes narrowed as she folded her arms. 
        Chinatsu didn’t respond. Ren came closer, and she finally spoke. 
        <br><br>
        “...I wanted answers,” she said. “I…wanted to find out what happened…” 
        <br><br>
        “It’s already said what happened,” Ren told her. “You’re not a Sorcerer, so I can’t order you around, but I will ask that you leave so we can conduct our proper investigation.” 
        <br><br>
        Leave. Just leave. Just leave, as if all that was possible. As if it was at all that simple. She couldn’t. She refused to. She absolutely refused to. She didn’t want to and she didn’t desire it. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu shook her head. Ren sighed. “Hm. You know you can’t take on all of us, right?”
        <br><br>
        “...I just don’t wanna leave…” she said. Her mind went back to how Obelac and Hello were talking with KT, and she wanted to scream once more. She didn’t know if she should feel betrayed, but she felt something that she couldn’t pinpoint. 
        <br><br>
        Ren was perhaps right. She did need to leave. She began walking forward, Nue following behind her. 

        <br><br>

        <br><hr><br>

        Obelac sighed as he, KT, and Hello arrived at one of Hellos’ safe houses. KT was laying down on a couch as Obelac and Hello sat at a table. 
        <br><br>
        “So, what’s our next plan of action,” Obelac asked as he looked at KT. The Sorcerer didn't return his gaze but answered all the same. 
        <br><br>
        “I’ll…need some time,” he said. “A month, just…just give me a month, alright…” 
        “And what’ll you do?” Hello asked. KT shrugged. Obelac sighed as he pulled out his phone and saw that Chinatsu had given him her location. 
        <br><br>
        “Hello, you’re bringing me to Chinatsu and taking us back home,” he said. Hello shrugged. 
        <br><br>
        “Alright,” he said. Obelac sighed as he leaned back into his seat, and looked at KT one more time.
