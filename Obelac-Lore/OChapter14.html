    <div id="content">
        Laeticia looked at Obelac, her eyes narrowed as she sat across from him. They were in her office, and the Lord
        was beyond annoyed at the fact that Obelac did not answer his summons. She wore a white button up with a black
        jacket and a long black skirt. Her eyes were filled with contempt for the Kindred before her, while Obelac had a
        nonchalant attitude to him.
        <br><br>
        “Where were you,” she asked him sternly. “How can you possibly expect for me to come to understand you when you
        ignore my summons?”
        <br><br>
        “I was with my girlfriend,” he told her.
        <br><br>
        “The Association’s Black Silence, correct?”
        <br><br>
        He nodded, and when she narrowed her eyes at that he ignored her.
        <br><br>
        “And are you aware of those she calls allies?”
        <br><br>
        “Nope,” he said.
        <br><br>
        “One of her allies is the Blue Reverberation, a man specialized in the murder of our people,” she said, the
        annoyance in her tone evident.
        <br><br>
        “Ok?”
        <br><br>
        “You’re fine with being intimate with someone who’s associated with a wretch like him who slaughters our
        people?”
        <br><br>
        “I mean…I’m associated with someone like you, even though most of the people I care about are Humans,” he
        retorted.
        <br><br>
        “...Fair enough,” she said. Laeticia would sigh as she looked across at Obelac. “Earlier you said that I know
        nothing about you, and you are correct. I also admit that I…haven’t been as accommodating as I should be in my
        duties.”
        <br><br>
        “You haven’t,” he agreed. She didn’t say anything at that.
        <br><br>
        “So then, who are you exactly, Obelac? How did you truly meet the Great Progenitor?”
        The official story Obelac told everyone was that he met Brunestud when he was lost in the forest, and she took
        him in. That was the truth, yet it wasn't the whole truth.
        <br><br>
        “What I said,” he told her. “...but I met her after my parents were killed by Cursed Spirits, and my home
        destroyed.”
        <br><br>
        “...And you were…eight at the time, correct?”
        <br><br>
        He nodded.
        <br><br>
        “I see…” she said. “And later on, ten years later, she sired you. Correct?”
        <br><br>
        “Yup.”
        <br><br>
        “...if I may ask, how was it? When I was sired, it filled me with a sense of pride at being elevated to a higher
        plane of existence. Surely it was the same for you?”
        <br><br>
        He shook his head. “I was scared,” he admitted.
        <br><br>
        “...scared? Of being blessed by the Great Progenitor?”
        <br><br>
        He nodded. “It was…terrifying,” he said. “It felt like…like I was being…abused, I guess. Like she hit me. I
        felt…wronged. Gross. And I felt so fucking scared.”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia kept looking at him.
        <br><br>
        “I never wanted this. I never asked for this, and now I have to do all this shit that no one prepared me for or
        helped me for…so of course I’m dogshit at this if no one helped me.”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia kept looking at Obelac. “I see then…” she said, then sighed. “Indeed…I have been very inefficient, and
        for that I am at fault. However, there is a thing that needs to be done regardless. You possess hatred within
        you, a hatred that needs to be tempered.”
        <br><br>
        “I’m trying,” he said.
        <br><br>
        “Are you?”
        <br><br>
        “Yes,” he insisted.
        <br><br>
        “Very well,” she said.
        <br><br>
        He waited for a minute. “So….”
        <br><br>
        “What, child?”
        <br><br>
        “What now?”
        <br><br>
        Laetica sighed as she crossed her legs and leaned back into her chair. “Now, I shall redirect my attention to
        your training,” she said. “We must figure out a role you can play, if you indeed wish to continue being a member
        of our ranks, you must have a role to fulfill. A purpose to have. Though I admittedly know not what that could
        be. You don’t have any talents that I could temper either.”
        <br><br>
        “Wow, thanks…” he muttered. Laeticia would stand up fully. Her blond hair was let down for once. It reached her
        back, and to Obelac reminded him of silk with how smooth it looked.
        <br><br>
        “I suppose first we could temper your abilities,” the woman said. “Have you awakened to your Cursed Technique,
        yet?”
        <br><br>
        “Somewhat,” he said. “Just the basics.”
        <br><br>
        “Very well, then. Since you seem to be only good for fighting, I will focus on that. From now on, I shall train
        you in perfecting your Cursed Technique.”
        <br><br>
        “Train me?”
        <br><br>
        “You heard me, there is no need to needlessly make me repeat myself.”
        Obelac rolled his eyes. “Yeah, but…”
        <br><br>
        “What?” she asked as she narrowed her eyes. “Do you think me incompetent?”
        <br><br>
        “No!” he protested. “I just…dunno, I guess. I don’t know.”
        <br><br>
        “There is nothing else to know,” she said. “You will train under me to perfect your Cursed Technique. You can
        use Reverse Curse Technique, can’t you?”
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, I can, I’m a fucking Special Grade for god’s sake,” he said, irritation clear in his voice. “Of course I
        can use Reverse Cursed Technique.”
        <br><br>
        “I will ignore your tone for now,” she said. “For now, you are dismissed. But return at the same time tomorrow.
        That is when your training will begin.”
        <br><br>
        “Alright…” he said as he turned to leave and cursed under his breath.
        <br><br>
        “Brat,” she said, having heard him.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>

        <br>Dane Simonson and King T watched the scene before them in shock. Dane had known Obelac for three years, and
        was one of the closest friends he had. In those three years, Dane had to fight tooth and nail to get the Vampire
        to show even a morsel of affection or happiness. To Dane, Obelac had too much hatred in his heart that needed to
        be mended, something he slowly worked to peel away. But what he saw took him off guard.
        <br><br>
        Obelac was with his girlfriend Chinatsu, and the smile he had on his face was filled with a sense of sheer,
        innocent love. The four were supposed to meet up to simply talk and get to know eachother better, but Dane was
        stunlocked at just how physical Obelac was with her. He was pressed against Chinatsu’s side, his arm wrapped
        around her waist and his head rested against her shoulder. Dane knew Obelac wasn’t fond of physical contact with
        those he didn’t know. He recalled a moment in the past where Obelac nearly fought Africa when the latter kept
        invading his personal space.
        <br><br>
        Dane looked over at KT and rolled his eyes as he saw the man he called brother have what could only be called a
        shit eating grin. “Hey,” he called out and waved. “What’s up?”
        <br><br>
        “Nothing much,” Chinatsu said. KT had never seen Chinatsu before now, and took a moment to remember her
        appearance. He could tell she was strong, stronger than them all even. He’d make sure that wouldn’t be for long
        however.
        <br><br>
        “Yo, Obelac,” KT called out. He didn’t respond, seemingly in his own world as he held onto Chinatsu.
        <br><br>
        “Earth to Obelac,” Dane called out.
        <br><br>
        “Huh?” he asked as he looked out at them. “Ah. Hey guys.”
        <br><br>
        Dane looked at him as he didn’t even adjust his position. He was adamant to keep holding onto her, and he
        figured Chinatsu found it adorable, since she kissed his cheek and chuckled to herself.
        <br><br>
        KT leaned into Dane. “...he definitely bottoms,” he whispered.
        <br><br>
        “The fuck?” Dane said as he turned to his brother. KT just laughed, and the four would soon be seated. Dane and
        KT sat together, while Obelac and Chinatsu were together. They were shoulder to shoulder, with Obelac’s head
        still against her shoulder as he looked through the menu.
        <br><br>
        “So, what’s it like, being a Sorcerer,” Chinatsu asked them as her boyfriend leaned into her.
        <br><br>
        “Fun, sometimes,” KT said. “At least when I get a good fight.”
        <br><br>
        Dane sighed. “It’s not supposed to be fun, T. It’s a thankless job.”
        <br><br>
        “It’s lame,” Obelac interjected. “But he’s right…a garbage job but still a job.”
        <br><br>
        KT rolled his eyes. “Jeez you two need to loosen up…” he muttered. “Anyway, Chinatsu, you’re a monster hunter,
        yeah? What monsters do you hunt?”
        <br><br>
        “Nightmares,” she said as a waiter came to hand them all glasses of water. “Basically…imagine them as Cursed
        Spirits born from a person’s dream instead of negative emotion.”
        <br><br>
        “Huh…” KT pondered for a moment. “That’s interesting.”
        <br><br>
        “I guess,” she said. “They can be…a lot to handle at times, but I can do it.”
        <br><br>
        “Work is like that,” Dane nodded in agreement. “Even if T here just complains all the while.”
        <br><br>
        “Fuck you too,” KT laughed. Dane smiled as well, and Obelac chuckled.
        <br><br>
        Dane took a moment to look through the restaurant’s menu and decided on some chicken.
        <br><br>
        “I think I’ll get some ribs,” KT said as he sipped on his water. “What about you, Obby?”
        <br><br>
        He thought about it for a moment. “I’ll get whatever Natsu gets.”
        <br><br>
        “You sure,” KT asked.
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, cause if he doesn’t he’ll deliberate over chicken, ribs, brisket, a burger, or a pulled pork sandwich,”
        Dane teased. Obelac rolled his eyes.
        <br><br>
        “Whatever…” he mumbled. “...though I am kinda hungry, actually…”
        <br><br>
        “Hm? Oh, yeah, vampire,” KT said. He saw Obelac look at Chinatsu rather embarrassedly.
        <br><br>
        “You don’t mind if we…”
        <br><br>
        She chuckled a bit. “Nah, it’s fine. Give us a minute or two, alright? We’ll be back.”
        Dane simply nodded as he saw the two get up and leave.
        <br><br>
        “...freaks,” KT said as he drank his water.
        <br><br>
        Dane sighed. “It’s not like Obelac can help it…whatever it is…”
        <br><br>
        “So you think they’re gonna fuck or-”
        <br><br>
        “KT!”
        <br><br>
        “I’m just kidding! But…I’ve never seen Obelac that clingy before. He’s like a puppy.”
        “...yeah,” Dane said, smiling a bit, “I’m happy for him.”
        <br><br>
        “Same,” KT said. “Now it doesn’t feel like he’s silently judging me.”
        <br><br>
        “...yeah…”
        <br><br>
        “...the fuck was that?”
        <br><br>
        “Nothing.”
        <br><br>
        The couple soon returned several minutes later. Though nothing seemed out of the ordinary, the two could tell
        that more than just blood sucking happened between the two, yet didn’t mention it.
        <br><br>
        The embarrassed look on Obelac’s face was more than enough proof. Truth be told, Obelac couldn’t help the
        emotions he felt when he drank Chinatsu’s blood, and it wasn’t his fault said emotions always lead to the two
        acting on it. He personally blamed his biology for that.
        <br><br>
        The two sat down, and Dane just smiled to himself, happy that Obelac had someone who cared for him as much as he
        and Demon did.
        <br><br>
        “Freaks,” KT said, which made Chinatsu spit out her water.
        <br><br>
        “What!?”
        <br><br>
        He didn’t say anything, instead he just sipped his water and grinned.
        <br><br>
        “What the hell did you just say?”
        <br><br>
        “Nothing,” King T lied.
        <br><br>
        Dane sighed. “Ignore him…”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu rolled their eyes, and soon their waiter came to take their orders. Obelac recognized them, because
        they were one of his friends, Chris. Chris was around his age, a Latino with black long, messy hair, tanned
        skin, and brown eyes. He was around six feet in height, and was rather muscular.
        <br><br>
        “Hey, Ob,” Chris said as he looked at the small group.
        <br><br>
        “Hey Jesus,” Obelac said.
        <br><br>
        “...Jesus?” Dane asked.
        <br><br>
        Chris chuckled. “Yeah…it was a nickname I got when I was a kid. I swapped out my mom’s water bottle with grape
        juice to prank her…well I thought it was grape juice, at least.”
        <br><br>
        KT laughed a little at this, while Dane chuckled.
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, I got my ass beat, but it was funny,” Chris said. “Anyway, what can I get you guys?”
        <br><br>
        “I’ll have the shrimp tacos,” KT said. “And some water.”
        <br><br>
        “Steak, medium well,” Dane told Chris. “And water too.”
        <br><br>
        “I’ll…have the pulled pork sandwich with a Sprite,” Chinatsu said. “And so’ll he.”
        <br><br>
        Chris chuckled. “Wow, Ob’s really whipped, isn’t he?”
        <br><br>
        KT bursted out laughing, and Obelac turned to Chris in embarrassment. “Can I not just want a pulled pork?”
        <br><br>
        “No,” KT said as he tried to catch his breath. “No, you can’t…”
        <br><br>
        Obelac sighed. “Jerks…” he said with a smile. “And give me a Root Beer, Jesus.”
        <br><br>
        “Rodger rodger,” Chris said as he left.
        <br><br>
        “So, any fun missions?” Obelac asked the two before him.
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, actually,” Dane said. “We were tasked by the Gojo Clan for something.”
        <br><br>
        “The Gojo Clan?” Chinatsu asked in genuine surprise. “That’s…something.”
        <br><br>
        “You know anyone there?” KT asked.
        <br><br>
        “Yeah,” Chinatsu told him. “One person. My older brother Tadame’s old best friend, Jozu. When I was around
        fifteen, they had a falling out.”
        <br><br>
        “You know why?” Dane asked. She shook her head. “All he told me was that they’d kill eachother if they ever met
        again.”
        <br><br>
        “That’s…weird,” Obelac said. Chinatsu shrugged, and their food would eventually arrive.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>
        <br>Brunestud was dressed in a formal outfit consisting of a short white dress, black leggings, and white heels.
        Her hair was done as usual, a long braid that flowed down to the edge of her back. She wore her signature
        diamond earrings with a cross detailed in the center. The Vampire was out and about with her son, Obelac. He
        wore a black button up shirt with black slacks and dress shoes. The two were out to eat at a restaurant the
        Great Progenitor had wanted to visit. It existed for over a hundred years, and was founded by a Vampire who had
        separated from the greater society to pursue a career in cooking in the world of Humans.
        <br><br>
        As they approached, the eyes of humans would be drawn toward them, and for obvious reasons. There was an eight
        foot tall pale skinned woman who seemed to have been ripped right out of ancient mythology, and that wasn’t far
        off from the mark either. Brunestud had an aura of sheer otherworldliness that even a human who couldn’t see
        curses could acknowledge.
        Obelac noticed their stares, and that made him feel angry. Brunestud didn’t seem to have minded, but he wished
        she had.
        <br><br>
        When they entered the restaurant, Brunestud bent over to be able to fit through. “Doors,” she chuckled, her
        voice warm and sweet like honey. “Never quite got used to how small humans are.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac chuckled at that. He remembered the last time he and his mother went together to get something to eat at
        a high end restaurant. He didn’t know how she could afford such things, but she was able to. If anyone were to
        be able to afford all sorts of Michelin star food, it would be his mother.
        <br><br>
        The hostess would greet them. She was a smaller woman with tanned skin and blonde hair. She wore a black button
        up and black slacks, and stared up at Brunestud as she approached.
        <br><br>
        “Hello, dear,” Brunestud said as she gave her a warm smile. “Table for two?”
        <br><br>
        “Y-yeah, s-sure…” she said, unable to keep her eyes off the giant woman. She hurriedly went to find a seat for
        the two that would accommodate Brunestud, before she then decided to pick a booth for them to sit at. The
        customers all stared at them, and Obelac tried his best to ignore them as he sat down. Brunestud sat down as
        well, the seat creaking a bit under her weight.
        <br><br>
        “Hmm…so this is what Roboute’s spawn devised…” she muttered as she looked around. The restaurant was lavish to
        say the least. Chandeliers lit up the area, and the floor was made of a white marble. Pillars held up the
        ceiling, and the walls were made of a dark oak. Everyone there was dressed in expensive clothing, and the sight
        of all this reminded Obelac of his meeting with Nerd.
        <br><br>
        ‘<i>Do all of those Sorcerers have a purpose? A genuine role that they and they alone can fulfill? One that you
            or I can’t surpass them in? No. They don’t. A cook cannot become a warrior, a warrior cannot become a cook.
            A king can’t become a fisherman nor a fisherman a king. Everyone has something they’re good at, but this
            world is one where their skills are wasted away.</i>’
        <br><br>
        Obelac was loath to admit that he did not know what he was good for, something that Laetica was happy to make
        him remember at any opportune moment. All he knew was fighting, and he didn’t know what else he could do.
        <br><br>
        ‘You are a warrior. Pretending to be anything else is not only unsightly, it is an insult to yourself.’
        <br><br>
        Obelac sighed and shook his head as if to evaporate Nerd’ words. He could think of his faults and such later.
        All that mattered at the moment was spending time with his mother.
        <br><br>
        Brunestud leaned forward in the seat, her back arched as she practically hovered over Obelac. “So, how is your
        girlfriend,” she asked.
        <br><br>
        “Ah, Chinatsu’s good,” he said. “We actually went out with a few of my friends yesterday.”
        <br><br>
        “Oh? Dane and Demon?”
        <br><br>
        “No,” he said. “Dane and-”
        <br><br>
        Obelac paused. He had just realized he called KT his friend, even if inadvertently. “KT. You wouldn’t know him.”
        <br><br>
        “I see…” she said. “And what is he like?”
        <br><br>
        “A handful,” he said. “He’s…a lot.”
        <br><br>
        “Is he nice?”
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, yeah. He is. He’s a lot, but he’s a good guy.”
        <br><br>
        “I’m glad,” she said. “I’m proud of you, Obelac, for coming so far.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac felt his heart sing at her words, and then melt as she gave him that warm smile she gave whenever he did
        something that made her happy. He turned to the side to try and hide the exuberant smile that slowly forced its
        way onto his face. “Thanks, mom…” he said. Brunestud kept smiling as she then looked at the menu.
        <br><br>
        “Hmmm…quite a lot of options…” she said. Obelac looked at it as well, and noticed that the restaurant served a
        range of food, from seafood to asian food and mexican food. He decided he’d get salmon.
        <br><br>
        When the waiter came, he’d also be taken aback at Brunestud’s appearance. “Ah…your orders?”
        <br><br>
        “I’d like the chicken curry,” Brunestud said.
        <br><br>
        “I’ll have the salmon,” Obelac told him.
        <br><br>
        The waiter nodded. “And for drinks?”
        <br><br>
        “We’ll both have the Robutian Mix.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac blinked at that, and the waiter simply nodded. “The drinks will be here soon,” he said, then left.
        <br><br>
        “...Robutian Mix?” he asked.
        <br><br>
        “Yes,” she said. “From what Lionel has told me, he has been researching the production of artificial blood.”
        <br><br>
        “...really?”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud nodded. “The Robutian Mix is popular for Vampires who visit. Its taste apparently changes depending on
        who drinks it.”
        <br><br>
        “Got it…” he said. Obelac felt a twinge of inadequacy at that.
        <br><br>
        “Truly, he amazes me every day with his genius.”
        <br><br>
        “Right….” he said, annoyed at the fact his jealousy only grew. “Well what about you, mom? What’ve you been doing
        lately?”
        <br><br>
        “I’ve been getting familiar with my other children,” she said. “The Second Generation Kindred who remain from my
        children and the younger generations as well. There are quite a lot, yet it was…nice, to learn more of them and
        their stories. I found the older one's treated me with such reverence, while the younger Kindred were
        more…relaxed in their respect. Such an interesting difference, is it not?”
        <br><br>
        “Guess so, yeah,” he said.
        <br><br>
        “And what of you? How has your training with Laeticia been?”
        <br><br>
        “...something, I guess,” he said. “It started off garbage, but she soon decided to train me in my Cursed
        Technique.”
        <br><br>
        “I see…” she mused.
        <br><br>
        “Mom…why her exactly?”
        <br><br>
        “Laeticia can be hard, but she’s fair,” she said. “Morever…if I may be honest, I believe you’ll be able to melt
        the ice of her heart.”
        <br><br>
        “...what?” he asked, genuinely confused.
        <br><br>
        “She’s so used to others treating her as a superior or as an equal, but I’ve noticed that of all the familial
        ties she’s taken on, mother, grandmother, ancestor, guide, she’s never once acted like a sister.”
        <br><br>
        “Huh…got it…I think…” he said. Brunestud just smiled, and their food and drinks soon arrived. The waiter bowed
        as he served it to them, then he left.
        <br><br>
        Obelac took a sip of the artificial blood and his eyes widened. It tasted just like Chinatsu’s blood, and he had
        to calm himself a little bit as he clenched his fist. He watched as his mother took a sip of the cocktail, and a
        smile spread on her face.
        <br><br>
        “Quite delicious…” she mused.
        <br><br>
        “What…or rather who, I guess, does it taste like?”
        <br><br>
        “If I may be honest, Lionel’s father,” she said. “...though…I suppose that would be my critique…”
        <br><br>
        “What do you mean?”
        <br><br>
        “Its taste…I find it rather…harmfully addicting,” she admitted. “I assume yours tastes like Chinatsu?”
        <br><br>
        He nodded.
        <br><br>
        “I thought so. Chiatsu is still alive, you can have her blood whenever. But Leandros…he’s been dead for nearly a
        thousand years. I fear…that those Kindred with weaker resolves may succumb to emotions long since past, and want
        to constantly feel them.”
        <br><br>
        She took another sip, and kept smiling. “But…it is also sublime in its accuracy,” she said. “The notes of a deep
        rich wine, of honey, of…nostalgia and happiness…”
        <br><br>
        He noticed her face brighten a bit, and he blinked in genuine surprise.
        Brunestud of the Crimson Moon, the Progenitor of the Vampire race, the Anima and the Great Progenitor, the
        strongest being alive, was blushing.
        <br><br>
        Obelac’s mother was blushing.
        <br><br>
        It wasn’t until that moment that he realized that the simple fact that she had been in love with Lionel’s father
        meant the obvious that she had been in love, and the more saddening fact that she had lost that love.
        <br><br>
        His heart ached at that moment. He didn’t know what he would do if Chinatsu died. He doubted he’d be able to
        continue.
        <br><br>
        He took a sip of his drink and took a moment to appreciate the taste. The honeycrisp like taste, the throat
        quenching properties and the rejuvenating aspects of the concoction.
        <br><br>
        “...god this is delicious…” he said. Brunestud chuckled.
        <br><br>
        “Love is something, isn’t it?”
        <br><br>
        He smiled. “It is.”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud reached forward, her glass raised to her son. “A toast then, to love.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac chuckled, and clinked his glass against Brunestud’s.
        <br><br>
        “To love,” he said, and then they both drank.
