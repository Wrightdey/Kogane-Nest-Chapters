                Laeticia Jaynelle
                <br><br>
                ~Arbiter of the Isle~
                <br><br>
            </i>
        </div>

        Laeticia sighed as she looked over the report of the incident that had just happened in Tokyo. From the
        information that Demon had received, and from other Vampire-lead investigations into the site, the entire city
        had been frozen over by the actions of Jujutsu Sorcerer King T and a weapon that could only have been an Eternal
        Blade.
        <br><br>
        She hadn’t expected another Eternal Blade to appear in the world after Excalibur, and yet it would appear that
        fate had its own plans for those it governed over. This entire incident required a meeting between all the
        Lords, yet only a select few were capable of heading to the Isle at the moment. Lionel and the Great Progenitor
        were both meeting with the Triumvirate of the Church, being Pope Sarin I, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, and
        Reverend Adam Holt. Laura and Glaston were launching their own investigations into the truth of what happened in
        Tokyo, for Laeticia knew how fond Jujutsu Sorcerers were of lying and making their own versions of history.
        Hayami was visiting some still living relatives she had in Japan, and Grennick was meeting investigating the
        link between the supposed traitors and Jussom Inc.
        <br><br>
        Laeticia sighed heavily. Her hair was a mess and she hadn’t rested since she met with Lionel. She at least
        needed time to make herself look presentable before the meeting properly began-
        <br><br>
        “My lady,” said one of her servants, Vendrik. Vendrik was a young man with neatly combed red hair and vibrant
        blue eyes. He was dressed smartly, and had his arms behind him. “Lord Larsen is here.”
        <br><br>
        “Here?” she repeated as she looked at Vendrik. She could see his ancestor’s face in him, those who served her
        long ago when she was still human. “How come?”
        <br><br>
        “He did not say, my lady.”
        <br><br>
        “Let him in,” she said. Vendrik nodded and left the room. Shortly after, Larsen would enter. Larsen
        Hannack-Warthek was, much like her, a scion of Horatio Maximus Superbus. Larsen was a cherished comrade, and one
        of the few that Laeticia could truly be honest with. Larsen was a tall man at over six feet in height with short
        brown hair and ruby red eyes. His skin wasn’t as pale as hers, and he wore a dark purple suit jacket, a black
        tie, purple dress pants, and purple dress shoes. He had a soft smile on his face as he gracefully entered.
        <br><br>
        “How are you fairing?” he asked her, taking a seat across from her as she stayed sitting behind her desk.
        <br><br>
        “...not optimal,” she answered. “So much has happened in so little time…”
        <br><br>
        Larsen crossed his legs as he leaned back into his seat. “Indeed…” he said as he looked around her office. “So
        much…so many new threats…”
        <br><br>
        “I feel you have something you wish to tell me.”
        <br><br>
        “I think we need to be on the offensive,” Larsen told her. “The Great Progenitor has returned back to us. We are
        as strong as we have ever been since the advent of our order, and it would be foolish of us to simply wait for
        other forces to take advantage of this.”
        <br><br>
        “You…are not wrong,” she admitted. “Though, as long as Kulani breathes, all our efforts will be for nothing.”
        <br><br>
        Larsen scoffed. “That glorified guard dog? No, I doubt she’d do anything.”
        <br><br>
        “You were not there, on that day three hundred years ago,” Laeticia said, her eyes narrowed. “The day we nearly
        went to war with Jujutsu Society, and when she appeared at the battlefield in only thirty seconds of combat
        starting. Yes, though we heaped high a pile of corpses, we still are not capable of fairing much against her.”
        <br><br>
        “The Great Progenitor is,” he said.
        <br><br>
        “She is,” Laeticia conceded. “Yet that too would be too much of a risk. Besides, what has gotten into you? You
        speak with a mind for violence that is unbecoming of you. Such thoughts are something I’d expect out of Obelac.”
        <br><br>
        “Do not compare me to that child,” Larsen said with venom in his voice. “Respectfully, but that wretch is
        nothing compared to me. Nor any of us.”
        <br><br>
        “You’re speaking rather freely,” she said. “What is the occasion?”
        <br><br>
        “Why aren’t you?” he asked in return. “Since when did you harbor affection for the child?”
        <br><br>
        “I do not,” she dismissed. “He is immature, frustrating, and tiresome. I hardly care for him other than making
        him stronger. If it’s not his attitude, it's his foul mouth, or his constant need to backtalk.”
        <br><br>
        “And you still wish for him to rejoin our ranks?” Larsen asked as he leaned forward.
        “I do not know,” she admitted.
        <br><br>
        “What I think,” Larsen began, “Is that he needs to be…separated from us. Permanently.”
        Laeticia raised a brow. “I beg your pardon?”
        <br><br>
        “The child, Obelac, has no purpose amongst us. He hates his people, he hates his duties, he has no proper
        function within our order of Moonlight Lords. He is a wasted seat, one that would be better suited if someone
        like Lucius or Kharn, or even Dante. They are some of the remaining Second Kindred left besides us and the
        others.”
        <br><br>
        “There is another,” Laeticia said. “Satomi.”
        <br><br>
        Larsen scoffed. “That fence-sitter is far too weak and ineffectual.”
        <br><br>
        “Maybe so, but I’d much sooner place faith in her governing than one such as Kharn.”
        “Then not Kharn, but there are other, much much more viable choices than the child.”
        “Maybe so, but the edict of Filial-”
        <br><br>
        “To hell with that,” Larsen said, his voice raised. “The edict of Filial Piety demanded we give governmental and
        institutional power to an, at the time, eighteen year old child who was, and still is, unprepared in the
        slightest. Despite your training, despite learning, he is still unprepared and unworthy.”
        <br><br>
        “Maybe so,” she said slowly, eyeing him. “But that is a decision for us as a whole, as we initially agreed upon.
        We all agreed with that. You, me, Lionel, Demon, Laura, and all the others, and it was sanctioned by the Crimson
        Moon herself.”
        <br><br>
        “That is not good enough. He needs to be dealt with.”
        <br><br>
        “Your tone makes me believe you do not wish to simply punish him…” she noted. “No, you wish for his head, don’t
        you?”
        <br><br>
        He simply nodded.
        <br><br>
        “That is treachery,” she said.
        <br><br>
        “It is securing the future of our people!” he shouted.
        <br><br>
        “Does the life of one child produce that much of a risk?”
        <br><br>
        “It’s what he reprisents, Laeticia,” he snarled. “He represents the weakness of us, the immaturity and the
        rashness and the vile humanity that stains the actions of some of us. He sleeps with those who would wish
        nothing more than to see us dead, and he works more as a Sorcerer than as a Moonlight Lord! He is the living
        breathing tumor that threatens us!”
        <br><br>
        “And if you were to kill him? What then? Demon would want your head, as would Lionel and the Great Progenitor.”
        <br><br>
        “We won’t,” Larsen said. “There is a plan, one that has been concieved ingeneously, that would allow for us all
        to prosper.”
        <br><br>
        “You forget yourself,” she spat as she rose up from her seat, her blood red eyes full of fury. “What you speak
        of is murder, Larsen. Plain and simple murder. And I will not entertain the thoughts of you or anyone else
        murdering one of our own, no matter who they are.”
        “How can you not see sense? He is the greatest threat-”
        <br><br>
        “He is a <strong><i>CHILD!</i></strong>” she shouted, breathing heavily with a foreign anger. “If we are so
        pathetically weak as to allow a simple child to be the end of us, then perhaps we should welcome the opportunity
        so we can evolve. If indeed we are that weak, then what does that say of all those who feel threatened by us?
        Listen to yourself, Larsen! What malady has infected your mind?”
        <br><br>
        “No malady has-”
        <br><br>
        “I think it has! You come to me, in my home, in my study, to speak of treason. Not a rebellion, not revolution
        or any other romantic view you may have deluded yourself into believing, but treason! Who put you up to this?
        Who seeded this…idiocy into your mind? Or have the centuries been far too rough for you than I thought? Who put
        you up to this? What wretch has-”
        <br><br>
        “Just listen to me, damn it!” he shouted. “If you would just-”
        <br><br>
        “It was Lucius, wasn’t it?” she said as the gears began turning in her head. “He seemed to have the most to gain
        from this. He hates that Obelac has more power than him. It was one of his Kindred that first found out the leak
        to Jussom Inc, and the one who his Kindred claimed to witness betraying us was indeed innocent. Only two people
        in the Isle have access to shapeshifting Techniques, Jia Yuanchun and one of Lucius grand-Kindred, Jason Sreng.
        Jason vanished entirely, which more than certainly confirms his guilt in this.”
        <br><br>
        Larsen didn’t speak, and instead he just stared at her, his lip quivering.
        <br><br>
        “You blasphemous wretch!” she snarled.
        <br><br>
        “I am no such thing!” Larsen shouted. “I do all I do for the sake of our people-”
        <br><br>
        “-You <i>have</i> gone mad!” she laughed. “You speak plainly of treachery, in the most idiotic, wreckless way of
        doing so! And you have the audacity to come to me and think I’ll aid you in this…<i>chicanery?</i>”
        <br><br>
        Larsen stared at Laeticia, and the woman glared at him. “Leave the Isle. Never return.”
        “I cannot do that,” he said. He watched Laeticia straighten up.
        <br><br>
        “You will. You do not have a choice in the matter. I, Laeticia Jaynelle, former queen of Laanes, Arbiter of the
        Isle, and the blood of Laertes and Horatio place you under arrest for the charges of high treason, Larsen
        Hannack-Warthek, Kindred of Horatio and veteran of the Hundred’s Year War.”
        <br><br>
        Larsen began to shake, his fists clenched. “You are making a mistake…”
        <br><br>
        “I think not-” Laeticia began, but her words were cut off as an untfathomable surge of Cursed Energy suddenly
        appeared in the Isle. It was a malevolent energy belonging to a Vengeful Spirit.
        <br><br>
        “Do not fight us,” Larsen said as he looked at Laeticia. “I do not wish for you to die.”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia kept looking at him, before within the blink of an eye she grabbed Larsen by his collar and threw him
        out the window.
