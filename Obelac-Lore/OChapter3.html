    <div id="content">
        <h3>Obelac laid awake, his mind at conflict with itself. Nerd’s earlier words rang in his head like the chiming of a bell. Ever since he was a vampire he had starved himself, never once tasting the blood of a human being, and because of that he had drastically weakened himself. Compared to other Vampires he was strong, yet compared to his contemporaries he was clearly the weakest of them. Demon was a Kindred lower than he was, yet her strength eclipsed his own. Even her being hampered by the sunlight did nothing to diminish her strength. Yet Obelac, being able to survive in the sun, was still inferior.</h3>

        <h3>The First Kindred, the Vampire Prince if going by his status, was weak.</h3>

        <h3>He sighed, and got up in his bed as he then heard his phone ring. He dreaded that it was another assignment, but instead found it to be Chinatsu. The rather forceful barista had given him her number in such a manner that he felt it impossible to refuse, lest he be branded a brigand (or a wimp) by the others in the town.</h3>

        <h3>He didn’t think much of romantic relationships, nor did he find himself wanting a partner or companionship.</h3>

        <h3>No, the second part was wrong. He did want companionship, but a type that only one being on this planet could give, yet he knew not where she was.<br><br>

        He picked up the phone, digital eyeing the clock on his bed counter and noted the time to be around one in the morning.<br><br>

        “Yeah,” he asked in a tired tone, more so out of emotional exhaustion than physical.<br><br>

        “How’s things going,” she asked him.<br><br>

        “Fine. Why? It’s like one in the morning.”<br><br>

        “Well I was awake still and wondered if you were. Ever since you came back from whatever had you out. You’ve been…off.”<br><br>

        “Off?”<br><br>

        “Yeah. Off.”<br><br>

        “How so?”<br><br>

        “You just have this…actually can you come over? I need to…I need to tell you something.”</h3>
        <h3>“Come over? Like now?”<br><br>

        “Yeah.”<br><br>

        “At one in the morning? It’s that serious?”<br><br>

        There was a brief yet eternal pause before she responded.<br><br>

        “….actually it can wait until morning. Yeah. I’ll be at the cafe as usual. Also, you still good for Saturday?”<br><br>

        “I am. Yeah.”<br><br>

        “Nice. Anyway.  Good night.”<br><br>

        And with that, she hung up. Obelac sighed as he closed his eyes and laid back down, his thoughts wandering as he drifted off to sleep.</h3>

        <br><hr><br>

        <h3>He found that the sun was unbearably hot that morning as he headed to the cafe. Upon entering he’d find that Chinatsu was there waiting for him, her apron hung up behind the counter. She looked exhausted, much like him. Her eyes were downcast and it seems as if she hadn’t slept in a little while.</h3>

        <h3>“Hey,” he said as he approached. A small smile came across her lips as she looked up at him. He sat down across from her, and Chinatsu leaned forward.</h3>

        <h3>“Hey,” she smiled. “Sorry for calling you so late, I was just…thinking.”<br><br>

        “Thinking? About what?”<br><br> 

        She sighed, looking him in the eyes. “About things. I…you think every good friendship is built on trust, right?”<br><br> 

        “Among other things, yeah.”<br><br>

        “Do you trust me?”<br><br>

        “Of course.”<br><br>

        She gave him a questioning look, and he felt taken aback by that. “Why do you ask?”<br><br>

        Chinatsu sat there for a long while before replying, her mind racing for a proper response before just saying the plain truth. “I know you’re a Vampire.”<br><br>

        Obelac’s eyes widened at that, staring at the woman in front of him in shock and surprise. “….what?”<br><br>

        “I figured you were at least a Sorcerer, ever since you first came here. You’re bad at keeping the curses you killed secret. But more than that…my brother told me.”<br><br>

        “Brother?”<br><br>

        Chinatsu leaned back in her seat. “….my last name isn’t Hayate. It’s Zenin. Chinatsu Zenin.”<br><br> 

        Obelac sat there in stunned silence, simply staring at her. “I…I’ve heard of you,” he said. “You’re…you work with the Monster Hunter association. You’re the Special Grade with the title of Black Silence. And…Tadame Zenin was there at the talks…”<br><br>

        “Tadame is my older brother,” she said. “My oldest. He told me that he saw you there.”<br><br>

        He signed, slowly reaching for his glasses and taking them off. His once brown eyes had been revealed to be a dark, blood red. “I am, yeah,” he said. “I…I’m a Vampire.”<br><br>

        She looked into his eyes. “…have you drunk blood before?”<br><br>

        “I haven’t,” he said, wishing to avert his eyes from her piercing gaze. Chinatsu’s earlier visage had eroded into the one in front of him now. Vulnerable but still powerful. “Not at all.”<br><br>

        “I see….” She sighed. “Obelac…why?”<br><br>

        He blinked. “Huh?”<br><br>

        “Why don’t you? Your power would increase drastically if you did. You could kill Curses better.”<br><br> 

        “I could, I guess,” he said. “I just…find the idea repulsive.”<br><br>

        “Then I take it you didn’t choose to become a Vampire?”<br><br>

        He shook his head. “My mo…someone had turned me. Against my will “ he said. “My Sire.”<br><br>

        “And that sire was Brunestud herself?”<br><br>

        He just nodded. Obelac closed his eyes for a moment. “Chinatsu…do you hate your family?”<br><br>

        She was taken aback by such a question, yet answered honestly. “I do.”<br><br> 

        Obelac didn’t seem surprised by that answer, and Chinatsu didn’t seem surprised by his lack of response either.<br><br>

        “Do you want to kill them?”<br><br>

        She didn’t respond, not to that question. Instead she answered with a question of her own.<br><br>

        “Do you want to kill Brunestud?”<br><br> 

        “…I don’t know,” he answered honestly. “I don’t think I can say I hate her. Not fully. I…resent what she did. I hate what she did.  But I don’t know if it’s because of my instinctual compulsion to obey her or my own feelings, but I just can’t imagine myself wanting to harm her.”<br><br> 

        “What is she to you?”<br><br>

        He paused for a moment. “…she’s the woman who raised me. Who trained me. Who gave me a new purpose after I lost my old family. My old family who I don’t even remember…”<br><br> 

        “So then, she’s your mom.”<br><br>

        “….yeah,” he said. “She’s my mom. I haven’t called her that in years…but she’s my mom.”<br><br>

        “Then let me ask you again. Do you want to kill your mom?”<br><br>

        He thought for a small moment before shaking his head. “No. No I don’t.”<br><br>

        “Good,” she said, sighing softly. “I never met my mom. She died when I was born. So I suggest you try and get to know yours…”<br><br>

        Obelac did something that he didn’t even process himself doing. Reaching forward, he placed his hand atop hers. Chinatsu looked somewhat surprised, but made no movement to push away. She bit her lip.<br><br>

        “I…I…”<br><br>

        Her voice was breaking as it seemed that tears were threatening to break through the dam held back by her. Chinatsu steadied her breathing. “I…wish I had something like that,” she admitted. “I…do want to kill them. My family. Or at least some of them. I just want to be appreciated…”<br><br>

        “I appreciate you,” he said. Chinatsu chuckled a little bit at that.<br><br> 

        “Yeah, I can tell, charmer,” she teased lightly. Obelac felt himself smile.<br><br>

        “Charmer? Me? I’m nowhere near that good with words.”<br><br>

        “Suuuuure,” she chuckled. “Say, you thirsty? I could make the usual for you. Free of charge.“<br><br>

        “I’d like that, yeah,” he said. “Thanks, Ms. Zenin.”<br><br>

        Chinatsu got up from her seat, heading toward the counter. “Also, mind watching them for me?”<br><br>

        “Watching wha-“<br><br>

        Before he could respond, he felt something lap against his leg. Looking down he saw a pair of black and white dogs. The Divine Dogs.<br><br> 

        “…huh…” he said. He turned to Chinatsu, who just winked. He found it humorous that while he had no Technique, the one living under his nose had one of the strongest. “Do you have them all?”<br><br>

        “I do,” she said as she started making his drink.<br><br>

        “…all?” He repeated.<br><br>

        “Yup.”<br><br>

        “Even-“<br><br>

        “Even him, yes. Even him.”<br><br>

        “…neat.” he said simply.
