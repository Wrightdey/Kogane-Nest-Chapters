        Obelac stared at the paper for minutes on end until he fully understood the simple, terrifying truth.
        <br><br>
        Dane had died.
        <br><br>

            KTkilled-</i>
        <br><br>
        His heart thumped in his chest as his hands shook. His mouth was dry and his eyes welled with tears as he stared
        at the paper.
        <br><br>
        It had to have been a lie. KT wouldn’t do that.
        <br><br>
        But Obelac didn’t know KT well enough to claim that. Not in the slightest.
        Theoretical, KT indeed killed Dane. Practical, there must have been a reason for it.
        But what reason could there have been? Nine million deaths…there couldn’t have been any possible reason for
        that. No feasible reason. He doubted even someone like Africa would’ve done such a thing. That was mass murder.
        If it was true that KT had done that, then the question would be why. Obelac knew he knew little about KT, but
        KT was not Nerd. He'd expect Nerd to do such a thing before KT.
        <br><br>
        Theoretical, The Higher Ups lied about this. Practical, KT did something to anger them, yet this event still
        happened. If KT did do something to anger them, what could it have been?
        Theoretical, KT was framed. Practical, who could have done it?
        <br><br>
        He looked over the letter again. It had to have been a forgery, yet he recognized the residuals of the
        messenger.
        <br><br>
        Theoretical, it was fake. Practical, the messenger was duped or complicit in it. Furthermore, there would be a
        conspiracy to kill KT. But why?
        <br><br>
        He wanted to believe this was all a lie, but he couldn’t bring himself to accept it. He wanted to believe this
        was all bullshit, but he couldn’t. He had no idea how or why this happened.
        <br><br>
        Rather he did, but he refused to believe it. He read the notice again, then crumpled it up and tossed it to the
        side.
        <br><br>
        Dane couldn’t have died, he couldn’t have possibly died. There was no possible way he could’ve died. But it was
        written that he did. It had to have been true, but if it was, then-
        <br><br>
        “Babe?” came Chinatsu’s voice, his thoughts severed as he turned to her. She had a look of absolute concern on
        her face as she headed over to him. “You alright? What happened?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac couldn’t speak, he feared that if he made so much as a word, he’d start crying. His hands shook, his
        breaths were labored, and his heart pounded in his chest. Chinatsu sat beside him, and she looked over the
        crumpled paper. She picked it up, unwrapped it, read it, and her eyes widened.
        <br><br>
        “...what the fuck?” she said, her voice full of disbelief and shock. “Th-there’s no fucking way, right? I-I
        mean…fuck…fuck my friends…Tokyo High…”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu shook with multiple things. Shock, despair, rage, Obelac saw all of that as she stared at the crumpled
        up piece of paper. Her breathing soon became ragged, and Obelac noticed that the room started to get darker.
        <br><br>
        “Ch-Chinatsu,” he said, uneasiness in his voice, yet she did not hear him. She began to shake as shadows began
        to spread throughout the room. The T.V, couch, walls, everything became engulfed in shadow.
        <br><br>
        “Chinatsu!” Obelac shouted. He placed his hands on her shoulders, and she recoiled in instinct, yet as she did
        the shadows receded.
        <br><br>
        “Fuck…” she muttered, then leaned forward into Obelac. He wrapped his hands around her, and his face began to
        feel wet. She was crying.
        <br><br>
        His heart pounded in his chest as she kept crying, wailing in despair as Obelac held his love tight against him,
        while Chinatsu rubbed his back.

                Interlude: Laeticia Jaynelle
                <br><br>
                ~The Arbiter of the Isle~
                <br><br>
            </i>
        </div>

        Laeticia stared at the report on her desk for a long while before she let out an exhaustive sigh. Daniel Atkins
        had proven not to succumb to the effects of breaking a binding vow with another person, and as such was
        acquitted of his alleged crimes. Likewise, Vespaspian Fulgurite was found to not be lying about hearing Daniel
        speak, so the only logical conclusion could be that someone had changed their form to be Daniel to divulge this
        information. Among those in the Isle of Lamia, only several had shapeshifting Cursed Techniques.The Fifteenth
        Kindred Jason Sren from the line of Fulgur was one of them. Jia Yuanchun, a Third Kindred from the line of
        Aurelia was another, and the last one was of her own lineage, Artemis Hayven, a Sixteenth Kindred from her own
        Bloodstream, a descendent of the First Kindred, Horatio Maximus Superbus.
        <br><br>
        Though the Great Progenitor sired many people in the Golden Age, only Twelve had chosen the path of combat.
        Those she considered friends, comrades, siblings, and allies she had sired and given the strength and blessings
        of becoming a Vampire, man woman and child. Yet they were farmers, scholars, those who wished not to use their
        gifts to harm others. That was until the Great War, when the Great Twelve rose to combat the Fell Dragon Vritra.
        They were the strongest Kindred, those who inherited the Great Progenitor’s strength the most. It is through
        them that the majority of Vampires can trace their lineage. Laeticia had met the great Horatio once, and she
        carried on his will as she tried to keep her people safe.
        <br><br>
        There was a conspiracy, one that threatened to tear the Isle of Lamia apart if she didn’t nip it in the bud.
        <br><br>
        “This is infuriating…” she muttered as she rested her face in her hands. Her hair was let down and spread out
        around her like a lion’s mane. Laeticia took deep breaths as she began to rack her brain at the inner meaning
        behind this. She hadn’t heard of any ills among her own children, nor had the other Lords told her anything.
        <br><br>
        To Laeticia, selling classified information to an outside party could only be done to reveal weaknesses to those
        who wished to bring harm to her people, and whoever wished to do such a thing deserved the cruelest death.
        <br><br>
        She would begin the investegation by interrogating Jason Sren, then move on to Jia Yuanchun. She would need to
        be deliberate and methodical in this. Anything that went overlooked could be disastrous.
        <br><br>
        She sighed as she rose from her seat and walked toward her door.
        <br><br><br>

                Interlude: Tadame Zenin
                <br><br>
                ~The Jewel of the Zenin~
                <br><br>
            </i>
        </div>

        Tadame Zenin was the heir to the Zenin clan and the third most powerful from that clan in recent memory. Tadame
        was somehow both handsome and beautiful, with long black hair that was tied in a ponytail, obsydian black eyes,
        and a soft face that made it seem it had never contorted in anger before. He wore a kimono, one side displayed
        the patter of crashing waves, and the other portrayed diamonds. He wore an ever present smile, yet only a select
        few knew that smile concealed his hatred toward his clan.
        <br><br>
        Earlier that day he had received a letter from Jujutsu Headquarters, one that confirmed what every news station
        in the country was reporting on. The city of Tokyo was, in some way or form, reduced to ice. The letter claimed
        that Jujutsu Sorcerer King T was to blame for this, and Tadame couldn’t find any fault. He knew of King T
        through his sister and what she told him of him. He couldn’t claim to know the young man, but there wasn’t
        anything to make him doubt that he was the culprit. Moreover, if this was indeed true…
        <br><br>
        Tadame sighed. Among the list of deaths the letter provided, one stuck out to him the most, one he used to call
        his brother, Jozu Gojo. He and Jozu were once hailed as the strongest, yet after a falling out and a brief fight
        they had gone their separate ways, and vowed to fight to the death should they ever come across eachother again.
        <br><br>
        Despite that, Tadame still cared about Jozu. He still saw him as someone he once saw as a brother, and the
        simple fact that he was killed by someone other than him filled Tadame with rage.
        <br><br>
        He knew that with the Jujutsu Strike Force after him, King T’s days were numbered. Moreover, with the power
        vacuum formed from the destruction of the Gojo Clan, he would need to capitalize on it before the Kamo or the
        Inumaki could. Either he would, or the elders would, and he knew they’d care nothing for precidence or anything
        decent.
        <br><br>
        Tadame walked through the Zenin compound as he tried to calm and steady his raging thoughts, though he couldn’t.
        Rage, confusion, shock, and fear all filled his heart. Rage at the deaths that stacked up every hour that the
        news stations kept reporting. Confusion at how this could have happened, shock at how fast this could’ve
        happened, and fear at what could’ve caused it all to happen.
        <br><br>
        He figured what he felt was what his grandfather felt when the Americans did what they did.
        <br><br>
        Tadame entered the garden and saw one of Chinatsu’s friends, Kyoko. She had white hair and wore a black kimono.
        He saw her planting chrysanthemums in the garden. Her face was sullen, her eyes dark and cloudy.
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu had told him of her encounter with Kyoko’s nightmare, one who took the form of Fuji, a member of their
        own clan. Tadame had personally dealt with him.
        <br><br>
        “Kyoko,” he called out. The young woman, barely older than twenty, turned to the beloved heir of the clan. She
        didn’t smile, she didn’t bow, she did nothing that most others would a man of his station, not that he cared
        that she didn’t. “How are you holding up?”
        <br><br>
        She glanced at the flowers she planted. “...my friends are dead,” she said simply, and Tadame’s heart sank at
        her words. “Hiori, Shinji, Hayase, Geno…they’re all dead…”
        <br><br>
        He heard her voice crack as she began to shake, yet he refrained from placing his hand on her. He didn’t want to
        make what she was going through even worse. Not after what Fuji had done.
        <br><br>
        “I see…” he said softly and knelt down beside her. Kyoka glanced over at him, her eyes still downcast and
        sullen.
        <br><br>
        “It’s not fair…” she muttered. “It’s not…fucking fair…”
        <br><br>
        “I know,” he said softly. Kyoka clenched her fist as she bit her lip and began shaking more.
        <br><br>
        “I hate this…I hate this…”
        <br><br>
        “Me too…” he said. He looked over at the flowers she planted. “If you want, I could help you build as proper a
        grave for them as we can.”
        <br><br>
        “...I’d like that,” she admitted. Tadame slowly rose up and Kyoko followed suit. He looked over at the bed of
        flowers in the garden, and with a wave of his hand caused dozens of chrysanthemums to bloom. One of Tadame’s
        Cursed Techniques was Wood Manipulation, and one of its abilities allowed him to control and create plant-life.
        <br><br>
        He looked down at the flowers, and felt his eyes sting.
        <br><br><br>

                Interlude: Agnes Hoffman
                <br><br>
                ~God's Visionary~
                <br><br>
            </i>
        </div>

        Ever since she was young, Agnes was told that she would amount to nothing. The Hoffmans were a Jujutsu clan that
        hailed from the New World, and whose prized Cursed Technique had the potential to rival that of the Limitless.
        Tachyon was a Cursed Technique that manifested the theoretical Tachyon Particles to manifest faster than light
        movement. Agnes inherited this technique, though her body was born weak. It was not a Heavenly Restriction, but
        a weak constitution. She needed a wheelchair when she was younger, and only grew able to walk upon reaching
        adulthood. Agnes believed her life would amount to nothing, up until someone took interest in her and her
        genius, Jussom Nerd.
        <br><br>
        Agnes Hoffman was the head scientist of Jussom Inc. and oversaw every single development and project that they
        made. She had just recently finished creating a series of surveillance drones that could record information real
        time and broadcast it to a specific location. These drones would be able to turn invisible by refracting light
        and blending into its surroundings, and due to their entirely scientific makeup, produced no Cursed Energy for
        Sorcerers to detect.
        <br><br>
        Agnes was rather short, barely reaching five feet in height. As she strode into the laboratory, she passed
        several of her subordinates who simply nodded in her direction. Agnes’ brown hair framed her face, and her braid
        was draped over her shoulder. The clack of her heeled boots was barely concealed by the sound of machinery. She
        wore a pair of circular glasses due to her poor eyesight. Beneath her white labcoat, she wore a white sweater
        layered over a black button up, and wore a black tie. Her gray skirt reached below her ankles, and her black
        leggings and boots at a glance were of high quality.
        <br><br>
        Agnes arrived at the set of large monitors that played a constant loop of the news coverage of what had occurred
        in Tokyo that day. Agnes was one of the few that Nerd trusted with the wealth of knowlege that he knew, and so
        Agnes knew the only thing that could be responsible for the carnage that occurred.
        <br><br>
        Within the world existed two weapons of immense, destructive potential that surpassed even that of the nuclear
        bomb, being Eternal Blades. The most well known blade, even to the public, was Excalibur. Agnes knew that Nerd
        bestowed Dane with a custom made Cursed Weapon, and that the only blade that could defeat what he gave him would
        be an Eternal Blade, not Excalibur nor the other second blade. There were of course countless questions that
        could be raised. The question of what this assumed Eternal Blade was exactly. The matter of how KT came across
        it, why did it choose him, and how did he let it get out of control were some of the more pertinent questions.
        <br><br>
        Agnes was able to solve all of the questions she had in less time than a person could blink.
        <br><br>
        Agnes used her family’s prized Cursed Technique not to enhance any aspect of her body, but to enhance her brain.
        Her brain’s processing speed, its thoughts and understandings all moved faster than the speed of light. She
        could read an entire page of a book, or memorize the entire scenery of a city in mere a plank second. Of course
        such a thing would be taxing on her mind, which was where Reverse Curse Technique came into play. It was common
        knowledge that the recently eradicated Gojo Clan rose to prominence due to the Limitless and Six Eyes, and that
        users of it used RCT to keep neutral Limitless active at all times. Agnes had no such need to keep her Technique
        active at all times, for such a thing robbed life of joy.
        <br><br>
        She analyzed the coverage, took note of the destruction, and did everything she could to try and parse just what
        could have done this.
        <br><br>
        A smirk came across her lips as her mind processed every minute detail that she saw. This was fascinating, truly
        fascinating. An idea formed in her mind, an idea she didn’t know if Nerd would accept or forbid her to enact,
        but an idea all the same.
        <br><br>
        She wanted to see if she could make a blade to rival the destruction that happened there that day. There were
        plenty of specimens that Nerd and his family had secured over the centuries that she could use if he permitted
        it, specimens that she would put to good use.
        <br><br>
        Agnes sat down on her chair as she leaned forward. This all was truly fascinating, so utterly fascinating, and
        she would do her best to unravel all that she could.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>

        <br>
        Obelac had sat on the couch for a few hours, simply processing what had happened. Dane had died. That was
        assumed fact. KT killed him, that was assumed fact, and yet there had to be a reason behind this. He knew that
        he had to contact KT. He had to find the truth for himself, and if he found KT’s reasoning to be lacking, he
        would kill him.
        <br><br>
        Simple as that, he would kill KT if he killed Dane for no good reason.
        <br><br>
        Obelac took a heavy breath as he rose up to his feet, then took out his phone.
