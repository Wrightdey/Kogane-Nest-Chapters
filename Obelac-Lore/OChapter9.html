        <h2><i>Three Years Ago</i></h2>

    <div id="content">
        Obelac groaned as he slowly woke up, the smell of pancakes filling his nose. Obelac and his mother lived in a
        wooden cabin she had made before he stumbled upon her, bloody and bruised. She healed him and took him in as her
        own when he was only ten years old. His parents were killed by Cursed Spirits and his town was burned to the
        ground. He was thankful toward Brunestud for everything she did for him since, from feeding him to training him
        to be a Jujutsu Sorcerer.
        <br><br>
        He slowly rose off his bed and made his way to the kitchen, the smell of pancakes only served to make his
        stomach growl. He heard a chuckle as he saw Brunestud cooking. The cabin was furnished with modern utilities but
        was completely self sustained. Solar panels provided electricity, and Brunestud had set up a system where their
        shower water would be purified and could be reused for things like cooking. The kitchen itself was built for
        someone of Brunestud’s height. The tables, shelves, chairs, and other amenities were far larger than a normal
        person would need, and Obelac had to have a custom made chair so he could eat with her at their table.
        <br><br>
        Sunlight shone through the window as he looked up at his mother. Brunestud was the most perfect person he had
        seen in his life. Whenever she smiled he felt himself smile as well. Her eyes were as red as rubies, and her
        skin reminded him of the lustor of pearls. Her black hair was tied in a bun as she finished up their food, and
        she was wearing a light blue sundress and a white apron he bought for her on one of their trips to the city.
        <br><br>

        “Are you hungry,” she asked him, her voice calm and like honey to his ears. He was eighteen, but still sometimes
        found himself falling asleep to the sound of her talking. It reminded him of when he was younger, and the
        thoughts made his heart warm with nostalgia.
        <br><br>

        “Yup,” he smiled as his stomach growled once more. Brunestud giggled at that.
        <br><br>

        “I do forget you’re a growing boy,” she said. “Then four pancakes might not be enough…how about a fifth?”
        <br><br>

        “Can I have six, mom?”
        <br><br>

        “Now now, you know that’s too much. Frankly, even five might be too much,” she teased him.
        <br><br>
        “It’s not,” he argued. “I’m a foodie! I can scarf anything down like those guys at hotdog eating competitions.”
        <br><br>
        “Then pray tell, why is it that whenever we go out I always end up paying for those food challenges you end up
        failing?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac looked off to the side at her words. “...that’s not the point,” he grumbled. Brunestud laughed softly as
        she placed his plate down in front of him. Six pancakes, a heap of scrambled eggs, and four pieces of bacon all
        for him. Obelac took his knife and gave his brief thanks before he ate. His mother sat across from him.
        Brunestud’s plate had nowhere near the amount she gave her son. She watched him as he devoured his food eagerly
        and barely took the opportunity to breathe. She had no idea how he could savor what she made for him when he
        inhaled his food, but she was appreciative that he liked it enough to do that anyway.
        <br><br>
        Brunestud smiled as she ate her food and finished at around the same time as her son. Obelac leaned back in his
        seat and let out a heavy sigh. He placed his hand on his stomach and smiled. “Thanks mom,” he said.
        <br><br>
        “Can you walk,” she asked teasingly.
        <br><br>
        “Of course I can! I’m a foodie, not fat!”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud smiled softly as she rose up and Obelac followed in suit. He stretched his arms and let out a small
        groan. “So, what’s the plan for today, mom?”
        <br><br>
        “Always so eager, aren’t you?” Brunestud asked as she playfully patted his head. Obelac pretended to be annoyed
        by that but made no movement for her to stop. “Well…there is something I want to show you…”
        <br><br>
        “Really, like what?”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud pulled away from him. The Vampire towered above Obelac as she looked down at him and outstretched her
        hand. He took it and she began leading him out of their cabin. They walked into the clearing surrounding their
        home and headed past the cut down trees and the makeshift swing Brunestud had made for Obelac when he turned
        thirteen. This small space in the forest was Obelac’s life. It was where he had first met his mother, and where
        he had found a new lot in life. It was where he was trained and where he found a new home.
        <br><br>
        Obelac didn’t remember what his old parents looked like. He barely remembered anything about the day his home
        was destroyed. All he remembered was that barely anyone could see why their homes were aflame, but he could. He
        heard rumors of Cursed Spirits, but always thought they were just stories parents told their children to get
        them to behave. He believed himself to be above all that childish nonsense at the ripe old age of ten years old.
        <br><br>
        He could not have been more wrong. He saw countless giant monsters as they scooped people up and ate them. He
        saw houses being toppled down, and two bodies that he knew to be his parents being crushed underfoot. Their
        faces were a blur to him. He couldn’t recall if their eyes were one color or another, or what hairstyle they
        had, or what shape their nose was, and whenever he came to the hope that he fully remembered doubt still
        lingered in his mind.
        <br><br>
        Brunestud saved him from all that. She was his hero, his savior and the one he would do anything for. She was
        his mentor, his mother, his world and his light. If everything he felt for her, the adoration, love, and sheer
        reverence he had toward the Vampire could be boiled down to a singular thought he had, it would be a single
        thing. Obelac believed Brunestud to be the strongest. He believed her to be his unstoppable, caring, wise, and
        loving mother. She was the one who gave him a purpose, and he would never forget that fact.
        <br><br>
        The mother and son kept walking deeper and deeper into the forest, the sun’s rays blocked by the trees above
        them. “What’s this thing you’re gonna show me,” Obelac asked her.
        <br><br>
        Brunestud glanced back at him, her soft smile never faded. “It’s something from my past,” she told him. “When I
        was around your age. Biologically, at least.”
        <br><br>
        “Biologically?”
        <br><br>
        “I don’t recall when exactly I came into the world. The earliest point I recall was when I had washed up on the
        shores of a small English town and was taken in by the people there. I believe I was…at least sixteen in
        appearance. This was of course over a thousand years ago.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac nodded at her words. “During the Golden Age, right?”
        <br><br>
        “Yes. The Golden Age of Jujutsu Sorcery. It was there that I met many friends, and…anyway, by the time I was
        your age biologically, around fifty years had passed since.”
        <br><br>
        “Weird…” he said. “Are all vampires like that?”
        <br><br>
        “No, it varies on when they’re sired,” Brunestud told him. “If a person is young they’ll mature until they reach
        their physical prime. If a person is old they won’t change at all after being turned.”
        <br><br>
        “Got it..” he said. Just up ahead of them was the entrance of a cave. Brunestud led Obelac inside, and he had to
        trust her to navigate him through the darkness. He held her hand tightly, and she squeezed his hand in
        reassurance. They traveled downward, deeper and deeper into the cave. Obelac’s mind raced with ideas of whatever
        his mother might have in store for him.
        <br><br>
        They eventually came to an area that had faint lights to illuminate the small clearing. Stalagmites and
        stalagtites were dotted about, and he made sure to not be standing near any. The cave had a faint purple tint to
        it, and Obelac’s eyes widened in slight amazement. “Huh…”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud turned to Obelac and bent down onto her knees to look him in the eyes. “Obelac, dear, you trust me,
        don’t you?”
        <br><br>
        “Of course,” he said with no hesitation. “I’d do anything for you, mom.” The expression his mother gave at his
        words confused him. He noticed she began to shake a little, and soon his mother firmly gripped his shoulders.
        Her hands were large and cold, and Obelac felt a brief but powerful sensation that he never expected his mother
        to make him feel. He felt fear, and the fact that he felt that made him want to die.
        <br><br>
        “Anything?”
        <br><br>
        “Anything, mom. I’d do anything for you.”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud’s lip quivered. “I love you,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “My precious son…my darling
        son…my smart, brave, strong little boy…”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud placed her hand on Obelac’s cheek, and he noticed tears slowly start to well in her eyes.
        <br><br>
        “Mo-”
        <br><br>
        Before he could finish, Brunestud leaned forward. In less time than he could process she was against him, and
        her fangs pierced his neck.
        <br><br>
        The earlier pinge of fear Obelac experienced had evolved into an overflowing wave of despair. His body’s fight
        or flight responses acted in overtime. His heart pounded in his chest as he tried to struggle. A cry of pain
        left his lips as he felt Brunestud hold him still. Her sharp red nails dig into his flesh as she drank his
        blood. He felt his life essence leave him as his mind screamed at him to fight back.
        <br><br>
        In the modern age, humans barely had any natural predators. There were beings that could kill them with ease,
        such as monsters that dwelled in the sea, or monsters outside of the purview of Jujutsu Society. Two things came
        to mind that could qualify as a human’s natural predator. Cursed Spirits were one of them, as they held nothing
        but hatred at worst and apathy at best toward humans. The others were vampires, as their existence necessitated
        them to feast on human blood.
        <br><br>
        Obelac had never considered that latter fact. He had never once in his life viewed Brunestud as a threat, and
        why would he? Why would the one who viewed her like a mother and as a hero ever consider her a threat? The one
        who raised and fed and clothed and sheltered him.
        <br><br>
        The instincts that screamed at Obelac to run or fight were the instincts that prey felt around an apex predator.
        The fear that chilled his bones and turned his blood to ice was the reason why all went quiet whenever a lion
        was on the hunt. His eyes grew red as tears flowed down his face. His throat was hoarse and raspy as he could do
        nothing but shudder in sheer terror.
        <br><br>
        He couldn’t scream. The fangs in his neck made it hurt whenever he tried to speak. His arms grew heavy as he
        simply stayed there, and with each second that passed Obelac felt his mind and soul sink deeper and deeper into
        a chasm.
        <br><br>
        His mind was aflame with thoughts. Why was she doing this? Did I mess up? Did I annoy her? Am I a failure? Does
        she love me? Did she ever love me? A storm of contradictory conclusions and reasonings formed to try and make
        sense of what was going on.
        <br><br>
        He felt his heart slow down, then his vision grew blurry, and then everything faded.<br>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Now</i></p>
        The rules of Filial Piety necessitated that Vampires obey those higher in the bloodstream. A Second Kindred was
        expected to obey a First Kindred, and all were expected to obey the Great Progenitor. Those who denied the edict
        of Filial Piety would be tried for the severity of their crime. No one would be exempt from that, not even those
        sired directly by the progenitor herself.<br><br>

        All of those rules and edicts flew out the window as Obelac lunged at the woman he once used to call mother. He
        balled his fist and with all his burgeoning might threw a punch at her. The ground cracked and the shockwave
        from the blow caused dirt to kick up and trees to rustle. A gutteral roar left Obelac’s lips as he attacked her,
        and Brunestud would effortlessly dodge his blow.
        <br><br>
        She moved with grace, her footsteps silent. Her hair flew behind her as she leapt backward, and as soon as her
        feet touched the ground, Obelac went after her. Blow after blow was dodged as the woman never once looked away
        from him.
        <br><br>
        “I hate you!” he screamed out as his voice echoed throughout the grove. Tears welled up in his eyes as the
        memories of that fateful day flooded his mind. All the emotions he felt then filled his heart once more. His
        neck suddenly throbbed with pain, and that sensation only made him more frantic. “I hate you! I wish I never met
        you! You ruined everything! You should’ve just let me die!”
        <br><br>
        Words he may or may not have meant left his lips one after another, laced with a venom that could slay even the
        Hydra from myth. The two were dancing, Obelac threw futile blow after futile blow and Brunestud dodged
        everything he threw at her. “I fucking hate you! I hate you! I hate you I hate you I HATE YOU!”
        <br><br>
        Obelac’s fist crashed into the ground, causing a small tremor in the immediate area. He hastily pulled away as
        he lunged at her. His new speed was too much for him, and he ended up closer to her faster than he wished.
        Obelac grit his teeth, dig his foot into the ground as he then used the momentum to attempt to hit Brunestud
        with a spin kick. She didn’t try to dodge and took the full blow. Obelac grit his teeth. Frustration, self
        loathing, anger, hatred, everything that festered and stewed within him for the past three years began to bubble
        forth. His Cursed Energy grew more intense and violent as it flared around him. Obelac unstuck his foot from the
        ground as he threw another futile blow at her. Again and again, his misses only further fueled his anger.
        <br><br>
        “You left me! I trusted you! You never loved me, did you? You just saw me as some fucking snack, didn’t you? Of
        course you fucking did! You never did care about me just like how you never cared about Lionel!”
        <br><br>
        Had Obelac been the way he was two days ago there was a chance he would have been brought an infinitely small
        distance from death. He was strong, but there was a gulf between the strength of a lion and the strength of a
        dinosaur.
        <br><br>
        Obelac’s eyes widened as the hairs on his skin stood up. The air was moving, though he couldn’t see anything. He
        trusted in his senses and ducked, and the instant he did he could feel a few strands of his hair be cut from his
        head. A split second later the grove would be filled with the sounds of crashing trees striking against the
        ground.
        <br><br>
        Had he been in a normal state of mind he would’ve been filled with abject horror and despair, but in the moment
        he only saw red.
        <br><br>
        Brunestud’s movements stopped, her blood red eyes wide as she began to shake. Obelac didn’t notice this in the
        slightest. All he did was rush toward her. He outstretched his fist, his Cursed Energy flared as he let out a
        guttural roar. The space around his fist began to distort, and Obelac felt the bones in his fist shatter as he
        punched Brunestud in the stomach. The shockwave destroyed large chunks of the ground, and black sparks of
        lighting appeared around him as several trees flew into the air at the force of his strike.
        <br><br>
        Brunestud took it all, her head lowered as she stood tall, Obelac’s Black Flash powerless against her. He panted
        heavily. His knees began to shake as he looked up at her. “I hate you…” he said. “You were everything to
        me…everything…”
        <br><br>
        He fell to his knees, tears flowing down his face. “I loved you…I trusted you…you were my hero…mom….mom…”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud bit her lip as she looked down at her son and lowered onto one knee. She wrapped her arms around him
        as she pulled him close.
        <br><br>
        “I missed you…I missed you…” he said. “Please don’t hate me…I didn’t mean what I said. I don’t hate you I don’t
        hate you I never hated you I’m sorry about what I said I’m
        sorryI’msorryI’msorryI’msorrypleaseodon’thatemepleaseodon’thatemepleaseodon’thatemepleaseodon’thateme”
        <br><br>
        Tears flowed freely as those words left his lips. He cried out as he held onto his mother tightly, as if he
        feared she would leave once more. “I’m sorry…I love you…I love you…don’t leave me again…never again…please mom…”
        he begged her. “Please…”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud placed her hand atop his head and began to hum softly. He remembered the words that left her mouth.
        She sang it to him when he used to have nightmares of his home’s destruction, when he screamed in the night and
        she rushed to his room to rock him back to sleep and assure that everything would be fine.
        <br><br>
        “Gentle wind from the ocean…gentle wave from the sea…”
        <br><br>
        Her voice was like an angel's, calm and soothing, it was like a Cursed Technique in of itself. Obelac held onto
        her tightly as he tried his best to steady his breathing. He closed his eyes as he kept his hold on her, as if
        he was scared to let go. As if she was mist that would vanish at any time.
        <br><br>
        “Let the music of the ocean waves rock my little one to sleep…”
        <br><br>
        Obelac kept his hold on her, his breathing soon steadied as he just listened to her sing. The disturbance of
        their skirmish would lead to the immediate arrival of the Moonlight Lords, who all stood stunned at the sight
        before them.
        <br><br>
        None stood more shocked than their leader, however. Lionel stared at the two, his heart pounding in his chest.
        Brunetud’s eyes opened and soon met her other son’s.
        <br><br>
        “...mother,” Lionel said. “What brings you here? What purpose do you have in coming here, now of all times?”
        <br><br>
        His tone was far more harsh than when he spoke with Obelac, and for good reason. He was not Lionel, the elder
        brother of Obelac at that moment. At the moment, he was Lionel Harlow, First Kindred and leader of Vampire
        Society.
        <br><br>
        “Lionel…” she began. “I…wish to speak in private…”
        <br><br>
        The First looked at his mother for a long while before he gave a slight nod. The rest of the Lords, save Demon,
        would soon disperse upon his command. With Demon was Chinatsu, who felt apprehensive at interrupting Obelac and
        Brunestud.
        <br><br>
        Brunestud let go of Obelac and helped him to his feet. It was at that point that Demon and Chinatsu rushed to
        him while Brunestud walked toward Lionel.
        <br><br>
        “Why are you here,” he asked her again. Brunestud looked off to the side to avoid his piercing and accusatory
        gaze. “What brings you here, when you never showed interest?”
        <br><br>
        “...that is the point,” she said. “I…I’m sorry, Lionel. I’m sorry for failing you as a mother.”
        <br><br>
        The Leader of the Moonlight Lords stood there in stunned silence for a moment, before a smile soon formed on his
        lips, and then laughed. “Ah…so long have I waited to hear those words, but now that I hear it I wish I hadn’t.”

        It was Brunestud’s turn to be shocked. “...you don’t hate me?”
        <br><br>
        “Hate? No. But my feelings toward you will vary based on how you answer this. Why did you leave us, mother?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac watched Lionel and Brunestud as they stood across from each other. Demon and Chinatsu held onto him as he
        slowly began to heal from his earlier attack. The shattered bones in his fist began to regrow even without the
        need of Reverse Cursed Technique.
        <br><br>
        To Obelac, Lionel’s question seemed to be more personal. He figured that if the others were still around, he’d
        have asked why she was at the island. Obelac wanted to know that as well, obviously, but Lionel’s question
        mattered far more to him at the moment.
        <br><br>
        Brunestud took a moment before she answered. She glanced at Obelac before she focused on Lionel. “I…was scared,”
        she admitted. “That I might succumb…that I might have hurt you.”
        Brunestud choked on her words as she had to look away from Lionel.
        <br><br>
        The Lord of the Vampires stepped toward his mother. “Succumb…” he repeated. “I take it that you’re referring to
        your bloodlust?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac seemed genuinely surprised at that. In the eight years he lived with Brunestud he had never once seen her
        drink blood. She ate the same food he did, and he never heard reports of people who might have vanished from the
        nearby towns. He knew she was a vampire, but he also believed she was an exception in that she didn’t need to
        drink blood. He supposed he was wrong then.
        <br><br>
        “No, there’s more to it,” Lionel said as he looked up into their mother’s eyes. “I do not doubt that your hunger
        led to…thoughts that frightened you, but there’s more to it than that. I recall that before you disappeared from
        us that you grew more distant. You stopped siring Kindred altogether…” Lionel looked across at the destruction
        caused from Brunestud’s brief tussle with her son. “There is no reason to hold back your feelings,” he said.
        “So, mother. Tell me. Tell us why.”
        <br><br>
        There was a long pause when Lionel said those words, and Obelac felt that his mother wouldn’t respond. He
        watched as his heart pounded in his chest, and he saw her lips part to speak. “...I was weak,” Brunestud said
        finally. “I was weak. I was too weak to stay with you all. I let my guilt…my fears and anxieties build up until
        it was all too much. I never wanted all this…politicking.” Obelac noticed the sheer disdain she said that with.
        “I never wanted to leverage my strength and power over the very Church your father served and risked his life
        for! I never wished to fight against those I betrayed my own brother for! And whenever I had to do those things
        his words always echoed in my mind. He told me this. He said it was foolish to risk myself for those who’d
        forget what I had done for them. He wasn’t wrong. No. He was right. and in my weakness I ran away when I could
        have done something. Anything. I could’ve annihilated the church should I so desire. I could have done anything
        if I simply allowed myself to be ruthless. But I didn’t. I still tried to act with dignity. And in response they
        still hunted my children! Yes, Lionel, it was because I became so weak that I abandoned my duties! Because of
        this disgusting, shameful weakness that I believed was logic and reason that I allowed myself to be poisoned
        with. I was weak. I was weak and scared. Too scared to sire new Kindred. Too weak to reign in my urges. Too
        scared to try and have Humanity do to me what we did to Vritra all those years ago. And that was foolish of
        me…so damnable and foolish…”
        <br><br>
        Obelac heard how her voice shook with each sentence and rant she spoke. A good number of what she said flew over
        his head. He had no idea who Vritra was, or what happened a thousand years ago. He had no idea who Lionel’s
        father was, or what the Church had to do other than their reputation of vampire slaying. He had no idea the bulk
        of her rants or raves, but there was one thing that he had an inkling of.
        <br><br>
        “Mom,” Obelac began. He stepped forward, making Demon and Chinatsu let go of him. He walked toward his towering,
        shaking mother, and looked her right in the eyes. “Is that why you drank from me?” He asked her. “Turned me? How
        long has it been since you last drank blood?”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud avoided Obelac’s gaze, her red eyes glanced away from her son’s. “Five hundred years,” she said.
        <br><br>
        Obelac had refused to drink blood for not even a single percentage of that time. The mere three years he spent
        starved of blood was enough to weaken him. He was actively weakening himself from his refusal of that, a thing
        that was impressed upon him knowingly by Lionel and unknowingly by Dane. The hunger Obelac received from his
        starvation was only able to be mitigated by certain blends of tea, the main reason he visited Chinatsu’s cafe to
        begin with. Brunestud must’ve been through far more pain than he went through. Five hundred years of starvation
        and weakening, and yet she still took his Black Flash like it was nothing--or rather because it was nothing.
        <br><br>
        “And…when you drank from me and turned me…”
        <br><br>
        “It was because the hunger had gotten too much,” she admitted. “I was hungry, yet I didn’t want to eat. It felt
        repulsive. I used to be able to eat as I pleased, but as I grew older the more distasteful it became. The
        more…dispassionate. Those I feed from I view as allies. Comrades. Friends. Some even my own children. Yet as
        time passed it changed from an act of love to an act of necessity. I started to view those who willingly gave me
        their life force as less of their own people but more…bloodbags. That is the term some younger Kindred have for
        humans, I believe. Bloodbags. Such an apt term, isn’t it? Such a straightforward term for those we view as
        beneath us. I had begun to view my children as bloodbags. My friends as bloodbags. My comrades and students as
        bloodbags. And so I left so that I didn’t start seeing other Kindred as bloodbags. I was isolated for centuries,
        until I found you…”
        <br><br>
        Brunestud finally turned to Obelac, a soft sigh would leave her lips as she looked into his eyes. “I love you…my
        sweet, smart, boy…” she said. “I do. I truly do and nothing would ever change that fact. I raised you as one
        would a son, but the closer we became the more the hunger within me grew. Over time there was a nagging
        temptation at the back of my mind. The closer we get to someone, the greater the urge to feed from them. The
        closer we are with that person the greater it feels to feed from them as well. This sensation varies from the
        generations, to the point the youngest Kindreds have no idea what connection that could hold. But for us of the
        older generation, it is at the most potent.”
        <br><br>
        Her words made Obelac think back to the first time he drank from Chinatsu. It was such a pleasurable experience
        that even when the thought back to it filled him with warmth and embarrassment. He thought of that, of how
        Chinatsu urged him on and led him through it, and how it was absolutely different from when Brunestud fed from
        him. There he felt nothing but abject fear and horror. If he had to liken it to anything, he supposed it would
        be if a parent took a belt to their child, or maybe even their hand. It felt like a violation of trust between a
        parent and child. It made him feel scared and frightened and he wanted nothing to do with her.
        <br><br>
        “When I fed from you…it was from a state of sheer, unfathomable hunger. I tried to rationalize it to myself that
        you wouldn’t mind or that it wouldn’t be much of anything. I told myself that it was simply what a son did for
        his mother. I felt…like I was being guided by something other than myself. My hunger was telling me what to do.
        It is no excuse for what I did, and if you wish to hate me…that is more than understandable. But it is the
        truth. I’m sorry that I failed you…the both of you and all of my other children…”
        <br><br>
        Obelac’s body moved before he realized it, and he had pulled Brunestud into a hug. He felt his mother shake in
        his grasp and she’d slowly lower onto her knees. She pulled him close to her as she held him tight. “Are you
        still hungry,” he found himself asking. Brunestud knew what that question meant, but knew better than to act
        without asking.
        <br><br>
        “Do I have your permission,” she asked him. Obelac simply nodded, and she would sink her fangs into his neck.
        <br><br>
        The sensation that filled Obelac was one of nostalgia. It made him recall he watched the sunset with his mother
        when he was younger. It made him recall how he smelled her cooking as he walked into the kitchen, his stomach
        nothing but empty. It made him recall those sensations as well, the smells of the bacon and the cool chill of
        the air against his skin. He couldn’t even tell that she was drinking his blood, all he could feel was the
        warmth of a mother’s embrace. It was like she was singing lullabies to him as she rocked him to sleep.
        <br><br>
        He had no idea how much time had passed before he felt her fangs leave his neck. Obelac looked up at her as she
        wiped his blood from her lips. “Are you alright?” he asked her. “Mom?’ Brunestud looked at her son and only
        nodded.
        <br><br>
        “You three can leave,” Lionel told Obelac, Demon, and Chinatsu. “I still have more things I wish to discuss with
        her.”
        <br><br>
        “Alright…” Obelac said. In truth he didn’t want to leave his…their mother, but he trusted Lionel to have a
        purpose behind it. Demon and Chinatsu stood close by him as they left the grove.
        <br><br>
        “Are you alright?” Chinatsu finally asked Obelac.
        <br><br>
        “...I don’t know,” he admitted. “I am, I think. Or rather I will be. I just…wanna be with her more. I…missed
        being with her.”
        <br><br>
        “Even after what she did?”
        <br><br>
        “Even after that,” he said. “I…miss her, Chinatsu. And seeing her today…it reminded me of all the times we
        spent, of when I was the happiest before…” Obelac trailed off, looking to the side as he forced himself to
        continue. “...before I met you…”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu smiled at that. “Oh, you charmer,” she teased, which made Obelac turn to the side in embarrassment. He
        saw but a mere glance at Demon’s shit eating grin at their exchange and wanted to disappear.
        <br><br>
        “Alright, love birds,” Demon teased. “Let’s take a moment to wind down. The meeting’ll probably be rescheduled.”
        <br><br>
        “Right…yeah…” Obelac said.
