        <h3>
            Much to the surprise of Dane and Demon, Obelac was wearing something other than his typical white sweater,
            black jeans, and boots. Now he was wearing a red button up shirt that fit his form. His bulky glasses were
            switched out for a more slim frame that complimented him, and he wore more form fitting black jeans and a
            pair of red sneakers.<br><br>

            The two Sorcerers, alongside others like KT, Hello, and Nerd, were overseeing the training of forces
            belonging to the Church and Jujutsu HQ. Rather, all of them but Nerd were overseeing their training. The
            Jussome heir was detached from all this, which Obelac could only assume was because he vehemently disagreed
            with the very notion of this situation. He had thought much of their earlier conversation, and felt himself
            growing a small hatred of the Sorcerer before him.<br><br>

            Obelac was drawn from his thoughts by Dane poking his shoulder. KT was beside him, but Obelac had frankly no
            love nor affection for the Sorcerer. He viewed him, Africa, and others with the same disdain that Nerd did,
            a similarity that he absolutely despised.<br><br>

            Those who lived for combat, who wanted nothing more than to fight and disregard everything else, was the
            height of arrogance and disgrace as a Sorcerer. Obelac viewed them with disdain. To them, they valued their
            own hedonism and battle lust over doing their job of killing Curses.<br><br>

            “What is it,” he asked Dane, trying not to let his distaste of his closest friend show. Dane looked Obelac
            over, a smirk growing on his face.<br><br>

            “I see you got some new clothes,” he said.<br><br>

            “I did.”<br><br>

            “How come?”<br><br>

            “Can I not go shopping for myself?”<br><br>

            “Since when have you ever?”<br><br>

            Obelac didn’t have a retort for that, because Dane was right. Obelac never really cared for his appearance.
            He wore the same set of clothes because he couldn’t be bothered to pick and choose what to wear. The choice
            was pointless when anything could suffice. But here he was, dressed smartly and with care. For what reason
            he didn’t know-<br><br>

            No. That was a lie. He knew. He just didn’t want to admit it to himself.<br><br>

            Dane kept talking. “I know these signs. The symptoms. Caring about your appearance, the better posture,
            and…is that cologne? Cherry Blossoms? Obelac you dog-”<br><br>

            “Shut. Up,” he snarled in complete and utter embarrassment. KT was chuckling beside him, and Obelac felt a
            new height of annoyance he hadn’t experienced before.<br><br>

            “Now, don’t get mad at me,” Dane said. “It’s good that you’re improving yourself for your girl-”<br><br>

            “She’s not-”<br><br>

            “Not yet?”<br><br>

            Obleac looked off to the side, looking for any excuse to leave this embarrassing conversation.<br><br>

            Lionel’s words came back to him, of how his refusal to drink blood was the reason he was so weak compared to
            what he should be. He supposed if it had to be anyone it would be her. The mere idea filled him with a new
            wave of embarrassment, and he had decided to push it away for the time being.<br>

            <br>
            <hr><br>

            Obelac was drinking his tea as usual, sat in the cafe with Chinatsu across from him. He looked over at her.
            She seemed to have gotten a slight tan, though her skin was still as smooth as usual. Her black eyes shone
            with a brightness that reminded him of a gemstone, and a smile crept on her lips as she glanced at him. Her
            hair was let down fully, and he could have sworn that it shone as the sunlight down through the
            window.<br><br>

            He didn’t notice before just how strong she seemed to be. She always wore short sleeve shirts while at work,
            but now was the first time he noticed the musculature of her arms and her calloused hands. He didn’t fully
            notice how her build was like a boxer or a martial artist. Obelac never had to train hard, but Chinatsu
            didn’t have that luxury as a human.<br><br>

            As he thought of these, a new realization dawned on him. The reason he was taking in her appearance. He
            must’ve fallen in love.<br><br>

            “You gonna stare all day?” she asked, her voice akin to a sledgehammer as it shattered his thoughts to
            pieces.<br><br>

            “Stare? Me? I don’t stare,” he protested.<br><br>

            “No? But just now you were staring into my eyes like a romantic,” she teased him. Obelac looked off to the
            side in embarrassment.<br><br>

            Chinatsu giggled, pressing forward into the table. She reached across, took hold of his cheek and made him
            look at her. He didn’t know what was more distracting, the thumping of his heart or how warm and strong her
            hand felt. He looked into her eyes, and she’d reach out as she slowly took off his glasses. She placed them
            aside, and her black eyes bore into his red.<br><br>

            “Stop hiding yourself,” she said softly. “It’s not fair to you.”<br><br>

            “I don’t like this,” he told her. “Being a vampire. I hate it.”<br><br>

            Chinatsu sighed, and Obelac felt embarrassed. “How…did you get stronger,” he asked her. She let go of his
            face and leaned back into her seat.<br><br>

            “I didn’t have a choice,” she said, her words punctuated with a heavy sigh. Chinatsu crossed her arms, and
            she looked across at him.<br><br>

            “Did you have anyone to help,” he asked. “I know Liv is a Zenin--”<br><br>

            “--Liv left the clan by the time I was born,” Chinatsu said. “She was…an outcast. Her having a complete
            Heavenly Restriction along with being a woman made her hated. And once she left, I was born. A girl who
            killed her own mother in childbirth and who possessed the clan’s prized Ten Shadows. The only person who
            looked after me was my older brother, Tadame. My father and the elders hated me, but he was the one that
            protected me from them.”<br><br>

            “What’s he like?”<br><br>

            A smile formed on her lips, and the sight made Obelac’s heart dance. “He’s amazing,” she said. “He’s…my
            hero.”<br><br>

            “Your hero,” he repeated, the word foreign to him. He forgot the last time he considered someone his
            hero.<br><br>

            “If you need someone to help you, I’m right here,” she told him. She reached across the table and took his
            hands in her own.<br><br>

            “I’m scared,” he admitted. “That if I do it, I’ll lose sight of myself. That I might hurt you--”<br><br>

            “Obelac,” Chinatsu began. “You don’t have to worry about hurting me. I’m more than capable of defending
            myself or telling you if you’re doing too much.”<br><br>

            “Thank you,” he said after a moment. Chinatsu smiled at him as she got up, and Obelac stood up with her. He
            looked her over and took in just how beautiful she was. His heart pounded in his chest as Chinatsu pulled
            him over to a wall. She leaned against it, craning her head to the side to allow access to her neck. Her
            neck looked soft, inviting even, and Obelac felt a desire surge within himself, a desire he never once felt
            before. He began to drool as he came close to her, his lips slowly parted as his fangs were beared.<br><br>

            Obelac placed a hand on her shoulder, another on the wall beside Chinatsu as he pressed into her. His heart
            pounded as he came closer to her, his fangs mere inches from her neck.<br><br>

            Chinatsu didn’t move at all, she simply watched this. She reached out, placing her hand on the back of her
            head and let out a small wince as she felt his teeth sink into her neck. Blood trickled down onto her
            shoulder, staining the white of her shirt as Obelac for the first time began to drink the blood of a
            human.<br><br>

            “I’m alright, I’m alright,” Chinatsu assured him, keeping a firm hold of the back of his head. Obelac
            continued to drink from her as he moved to hold on to both her shoulders for support. His heart kept beating
            in his chest as he savored the divine taste from her. It was far better than anything he ever had before. He
            imagined it must have been what ambrosia was like to Olympians, or even the Fruit of Eden itself.<br><br>

            The more he drank the more his heart began to pump with desire and a new sensation: lust. An endless chasm
            of forbidden desire started to flow into him. He drank and drank from her, the taste of her blood on his
            tongue had quenched a thirst he had dealt with most of his life. However the more that was quenched the more
            the thirst grew.<br><br>

            Obelac loved Chinatsu. He wanted to be with Chinatsu. He wanted to spend his life with her, to know her in
            the most deep, intimate ways a man could know a woman.<br><br>

            He took in everything at that moment. How Chinatsu’s hair smelled like lavender, how she herself smelt like
            sweet fruit. He smelled the blood that he drank, the iron that mixed in with all this. He smelled the sweat
            that was forming on the both of them from how close they were and how hot their bodies were getting. He
            could hear their hearts thump and feel her shudder in his grasp.<br><br>

            His sensations were growing by the second, and he felt like he could keep going forever. At that moment he
            wanted to do nothing but to drink from her, to taste her and to stay against her. However he would feel a
            nudge as Chinatsu began to slowly pull him off of her, and despite his overwhelming urge to continue, he
            stopped. Obelac would catch his breath, his lips red with her blood, his eyes shone with a brilliance that
            they never did before.<br><br>

            Chinatsu’s face was flushed red as she also caught her breath. The blood on her neck began to heal on its
            own, and she never once looked away from Obelac’s eyes.<br><br>

            “I love you,” he said, unable to keep his feelings to himself for any longer. “I love you, Chinatsu. I never
            want to leave you.”<br><br>

            The woman wrapped her arms around him, keeping him close to her. “I…love you too,” she said, her own heart
            beating in her chest.<br><br>

            “I want more,” he admitted to her. “To taste you more.”<br><br>

            His words made her blush even more, and a smirk came across her lips. She knew what Obelac meant, yet she
            had her own wants as well.<br><br>

            “Is that the case,” she asked him. He enthusiastically nodded, and she found that cute. Unbearably cute.
            “Then taste away,” she said as she began to lower him onto his knees.<br><br>
