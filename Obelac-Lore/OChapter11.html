    </div>

    <div id="content">
        Dane, KT, and Hello were with Obelac at Tesoro’s compound. Obelac had wanted to train more in swordplay, and Dane was more than welcome to continue where they last left off. 
        <br><br>
        Obelac still wore his glasses for the moment as he looked across at Dane. Obelac wore black sweatpants, running shoes, and a longsleeve black t-shirt. He held his broadsword in hand as he and Dane circled across the other. Obelac looked him over. His newly enhanced senses allowed him to make out what he couldn’t before. As Dane leapt toward Obelac, arms raised up to bring his katana down a vertical slash, Obelac saw the minute twitches of his muscles. Dane’s scabbard was at his side, and Obelac met Dane’s slash with a horizontal block. The clash of steel against steel was loud, and sparks flew from the force behind their blows. Obelac saw Dane’s face contort with renewed effort as he tried to push back against him. Obelac fully had the physical advantage, but Dane was still better than him at swordplay. Dane pushed away from the clash and Obelac rushed after him before he could properly land on the ground. He raised his sword high and cut down, only for Dane to block it with the scabber of his sword. The force behind Obelac’s blow forced Dane onto his knees and cut into the scabbard. 
        <br><br>
        As Dane held on as best he could, he used this distraction to slash at Obelac’s legs with his katana. Obelac winced in pain as he leapt back to gain distance, and Dane would hurl his scabbard at him. Obelac’s eyes snapped to it and made an effort to guard himself, only for Dane’s sword to pierce his side. A fient. Right as Obelac swung at Dane he’d swap places with his scabbard and slash down at his student. Obelac grit his teeth as he raised his arm to block it. Unlike before, his arm was untouched as he pushed against Dane’s blade. 
        <br><br>
        Obelac’s strength and endurance had increased drastically, so much so to the point that he hand’t even begun using Cursed Energy to reinforce himself until then. Dane visibly struggled as he tried to cut through Obelac’s arm. “Just what happened since we last trained,” Dane asked. “Other than you getting laid?”
        <br><br>
        The brief moment that was provided from Obelac’s embarrassment allowed Dane to swap with his scabbard and cut Obelac in the back. The wound had begun to heal mere seconds after the attack was made, and Obelac quickly turned around as he swung his sword at Dane. Dane used the momentum from his successful attack to parry Obelac’s blow with the scabbard of his sword, then slipped forward and slashed at Obelac’s stomach. Though he blocked it with his arm, Dane then kicked out Obelac’s feet from under him and caused him to fall onto his back. It took a second for Obelac to recover and in the second he got back to his feet, Dane had skewered the ground his foe was once at. 
        <br><br>
        Dane smirked. “You’re really a monster now…” he said. “Just what happened, Ob?”
        “A lot of things,” he said as he placed his hand on his glasses. Obelac took them off and tossed them aside, and Dane’s brow raised.
        <br><br>
        “You turned into a Vampire?” 
        <br><br>
        “I was always one,” he admitted. “I just drank blood since.” 
        <br><br>
        Dane’s smirk turned into a grin. He took a stance as she sheathed his sword, and Obelac recognzied it to be his Heavenly Strike manuver. It was a powerful technique that allowed for a singular strike that moved at the speed of lightning. Obelac didn’t know if he could dodge it, but he didn’t feel the need to. He only needed to block it. 
        <br><br>
        That was until he saw Dane move forward. It was slower than usual, just noticeable enough that he saw the tension of his muscles as he leapt forward. The thought came to him that perhaps he could dodge it, and when that thought pushed his muscles into movement Obelac entrursted his heightened capabilities to enact that vision. His muscles coiled, and in less time than a normal humn could witness there was a massive shockwave that caused parts of the floor to explode. A straight crater in the ground was made from where Dane originally stood to where Obelac was. 
        <br><br>
        Obelac had thought he dodged, he truly did. As soon as he saw Dane land he’d turn around and swing his sword at him as quickly as he could, only to then realize that his sword was nowhere to be found. Neither was his hand. He looked around to see that it was on the ground alongside his sword. He was so very close to dodging Dane’s strike. “Damn…” 
        <br><br>
        “Wow, even a Vamp like you can’t dodge it,” Dane said. “Though…you are only getting stronger.”
        <br><br>
        “Yeah,” Obelac said. “Though I don’t know how long that’ll take…” 
        <br><br>
        His hand would start to regrow, and he’d pick up his sword from the ground. As he did this, he would hear KT approach. Obelac swallowed whatever unjust annoyance he felt and tried to approach him in an unbiased manner. 
        <br><br>
        “So you one of those freaky vamps who just use drinking blood as an excuse to put my neck in your mouth?” KT said, a light smile on his face. Obelac wanted to punch him. “Wait… how many times did you want to drink my blood?”
        <br><br>
        “I’d rather kill myself.” 
        <br><br>
        “Hm, okay you lil freak,” he teased.
        <br><br>
        Obelac hated KT at that moment. He felt offended at his words, even though he knew KT likely meant no harm. To Obelac, the process of drinking blood was something that he only did to someone he was comfortable with and cared about. The first time he drank Chinatsu’s blood was one of the most sublime moments in his life, and for KT to not only joke about it with such carelessness and vulgarity, but also to mock him was the height of ignorance and insensitivity. He felt like KT had called him a whore, even if unententionally. 
        <br><br>
        More than that, KT had insulted the very way he lived. KT was lucky to have been able to enjoy normal food and be sustained by it. Obelac longed for that day, when he could gorge himself on pancakes and bacon and be full. He hated that whenever his friends at the bar ordered meal after meal for him with the idea he was still hungry, when in actuality he wasn’t gaining any nutrience from the meal, and was just getting sick of tasting more and more. 
        <br><br>
        ‘<i>Freaky</i>’. The absolute gall that came from such a fighting obsessed, no mannered, immature moron with the intelligence of a ravenous chimpanzee made him want to puke. Obelac began hurling expletives at KT in his mind, his anger growing more and more. He thought that the hedonist before him had absolutely no purpose in saying anything of the sort, when fighting was likely more pleasurable than sex to him. He thought that the disgrace of a Sorcerer that stood before him should just disappear before he infected the world with his sheer stupidity and ignorance. 
        <br><br>
        The mere thought of his mouth anywhere near his neck made him want to vomit. He figured KT hardly bathed to begin with, let alone wash his neck. Every nanosecond that passed with him looking at his stupid face made him want-
        <br><br>
        Obelac let out a deep, unbearable sigh. He knew he should not let his anger overwhelm him. He knew he shouldn’t hate someone before getting to know them, like how he had hated Lionel. “Please don’t talk like that. It’s…insulting.” 
        <br><br>
        KT simply shrugged. “Sure thing, man. Sorry.” 
        <br><br>
        “It’s alright…” he said as he tried to collect his thoughts. He closed his eyes, only to open them as he felt Dane’s hand on his shoulder.
        <br><br>
        “You up for another round, Ob?” 
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, sure,” he said. Dane smiled, and Obelac felt himself smile as well as he readied his sword. 
        <br><br>
        Obelac noticed Hello looking him over. His face was void of any emotion, as if him being a Vampire hadn’t shocked him in the slightest. He knew nothing about Hello, only that he was odd. 
        <br><br>
        “You don’t seem surprised,” Obelac said. Hello shrugged. 
        <br><br>
        “I mean…I already knew,” he shrugged. 
        <br><br>
        “...excuse me?”
        <br><br>
        “I already knew,” Hello told him. 
        <br><br>
        “How?”
        <br><br>
        He shrugged again. “I just did.” 
        <br><br>

            <i>Interlude: Chinatsu
            <br>
            ~The Black Silence~
            </i>
        </div>

        <br><br>

        The Monster Hunter Association was a worldwide organization dedicated toward the protection of Humanity against threats that existed outside the purview of Jujutsu Sorcerers. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Demons, and other beasts that were not Cursed Spirits. Those who achieved Special Grade within the organization and completed certain requirements were designated as the Colors. These Colors were peerless among the Monster Hunters and were considered among the upper echelons of Special Grades in strength. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu Zenin was designated as the Black Silence and specialized in hunting beasts of nightmares. These entities originated from the Cursed Realm and migrated to reality. They were the manifestation of nightmares festered and birthed in this realm, who through growth had matured and appeared in the waking world. 
        <br><br>
        At the moment, Chinatsu was in pursuit of a dangerous Nightmare beast that she had dubbed ‘The Night-Haunter’. It was a large quadrapedal beast that had red eyes all over its body and a mouth of sharp, black fangs. It was around the size of a one story home. Each step it took made the trees in the forest it claimed shake. There was an eerie quiet in the air as it took heavy steps. Every breath was a snarl, and it opened its gaping maw. A long, black tongue protruded from its mouth, and its tongue had eyes as well. 
        <br><br>
        The Night-Haunter had eaten twenty people by the time Chinatsu was assigned to stop it. She watched it from inside the shadows as every animal around it fled and hid from the apex predator that claimed their home for itself. She could tell that its strength was around that of a Special Grade Cursed Spirit, something that would be effortless for her to defeat. The Night-Haunter roared as it thrashed against a tree and made it collapse. The sound filled the still air, and Chinatsu finally emerged from the shadow. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu wore a black, sleeveless top and grey cargo pants and black boots. She wore black sleeves around her arms and carried a pavise shield. She wore a necklace which bore a Special Grade Cursed Tool known as the Yasakani no Magatama. It was one of the Imperial Regalia of Japan that her brother had secured for her. It had the ability to protect its bearer from curses. 
        <br><br>
        She approached the Night-Haunter, not trying to quiet her footsteps as she held her shield to her side. The beast snapped its head around and its countless eyes all focused on its new prey. It snarled as it lunged at her. Its hooved feet dug into the ground as it aimed to trample her. Chinatsu rushed to meet it. Her footsteps would make small craters as she soon leapt into the air. Chinatsu shoulder-checked the Night-Haunter and sent it flying into a tree. It crashed through it and slammed into the ground. A crater formed where it landed, and as it slowly rose to its feet Chinatsu would snap her fingers. The Night-Haunter would start to sink into its own shadow.  It thrashed widely, its eyes filled with hatred as it moved like an elephant stuck in mud. It roared in anger and fury as it was brought deeper and deeper into the shadows. Chinatsu walked toward it slowly. Her eyes looked it over with no regard or concern. In fact, the expression she had was one of complete passiveness. If the Night-Haunter viewed itself as an apex predator, then Chinatsu was something that transcended the food chain altogether. She was soon in front of it. The beast roared and its putrid breath blew back her hair. Chinatsu’s eyes narrowed. She closed her fist and the shadow that slowly absorbed it closed all of a sudden. The Night-Haunter’s lower half had disappeared, and as it screamed out in pain Chinatsu would absorb the rest of the beast in her shadows. There was not a trace of it left. 
        <br><br>
        As Chinatsu turned to leave, she would hear clapping. She was not surprised. Truth be told, she knew there was another in that forest with her. She turned to the sound of the clapping and saw a familiar face slink out from the trees. He was a lithe, graceful man with flowing white hair that stretched to his lower back, piercing brown eyes, and pale skin. He wore a blue, silk suit with white pants and blue dress shoes. He wore a blue cape as well, and had an eerie smile on his lips. He had a rapier at his side, and he sauntered over to Chinatsu. His name was Argalia Grayson, the Blue Reverberation and the Association’s leading Vampire hunter. 
        <br><br>
        “Well done,” he smiled, his voice smooth like silk yet painfully condescending all the same. Argalia was a solid decade older than Chinatsu, though she couldn’t tell at a glance. He looked more like a doll or a fairy than a human. Nothing about him seemed mortal. 
        <br><br>
        “Why are you here,” she asked him as she spoke for the first time. 
        <br><br>
        “Just curious,” he said as he placed a hand on his hip. “I wanted to see how my coworker was doing, is that so wrong?” 
        <br><br>
        “Why not check on Santiago or Gebura?”
        <br><br>
        “I hate the sea,” he sighed. “And Gebura is too…much, for a man of my tastes.” 
        <br><br>
        “You mean you’re scared she’ll kill you if you annoy her too much,” Chinatsu snarked. Argalia ignored that. 
        <br><br>
        “Regardless, I do have a question,” he said as he came closer to her. “Does he know?”
        “What are you talking about?”
        <br><br>
        “Your boyfriend. Does he know your true identity?” 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu glared at him. “What are you talking about?”
        <br><br>
        “Oh, you think I didn’t notice?” he laughed. “Chinatsu, you can’t hide such things from me. I’ve been hunting bloodsuckers for a decade at this point. I’ve slaughtered so many and seen so many so-called ‘blood bags’ that I picked up a knack for identifying them. Firstly, when someone gets their blood sucked by a Vampire, their Cursed Energy fluctuates. A combination of the Vampire’s and the human’s energies causes irregularities to form. Of course it vanishes with time, but when you came to our meeting I noticed it. The boy you were getting close to…he’s a Kindred, isn’t he?”
        <br><br>
        “You know about him?” 
        <br><br>
        “I do. Surely you’re not surprised? I looked into him and lo and behold, Chinatsu snagged a Moonlight Lord! I was quite entertained by that.”
        <br><br>
        She glared at him. “That doesn’t change the question of why you’re here, still.” 
        <br><br>
        “As I said, I was curious. How would he feel if he knew you worked with someone responsible for the death of so many of his people?” 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu could hear the sheer euphoria with which Argalia asked that question, though she also knew the truth. Obelac wouldn’t care. He had spent so long hating vampires that accepting not only himself but the entirety of his species wasn’t an immediate thing for him. She shrugged in response to Argalia’s question. 
        <br><br>
        “I see. In any case, I suggest you tread carefully,” he said. “I’d hate to accidentally attack you in the event you’re around those leeches.”
        <br><br>
        “And I suggest you stay away from him or else I’ll make sure you regret it.” 
        <br><br>
        Argalia smiled. “Alright, Ms. Zenin,” he said. “And I hope you appreciate my book I lent you, though I’d need to make a new addition to include your little boyfriend.” He bowed then turned away. Chinatsu rolled her eyes as she walked in the opposite way of Argalia. Her stomach growled, and she’d sigh. 
        <br><br>
        “Jeez…” she muttered. “Fucking dickhead…”
