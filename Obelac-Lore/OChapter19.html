        <h1>Chapter Nineteen: Show Me It's All Fake</h1><br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
        Obelac and Hello met with Chinatsu in a temple, the Ōfuna Kannon Temple, in Kamakura, a neighboring city to
        Tokyo. They passed through several gates and concerned people who more likely than not came there to pray. They
        walked up a flight of stairs and saw a white Kanon statue above them. For whatever reason, there weren't as many
        people in that section of the temple, and as they came to the top of the stairs they could see that the statue
        was large enough to be entered from the outside. Obelac walked on, and inside the statue he saw countless
        smaller statues of what he believed to be the Buddha, and Chinatsu. She was silent as she stared at the statues,
        and she looked exhausted.
        <br><br>
        “China…” Obelac called out as he approached her from behind. She didn’t answer, keeping her gaze at the statues.
        Her fists were clenched, and her breathing ragged. Obelac reached out to take a hold of her hand, and she didn’t
        fight back. She kept staring at the statues before she finally spoke.
        <br><br>
        “...did you know that this place was built for a prayer of a world without war or nuclear weapons,” she said,
        her voice barely above a whisper. “I didn’t, I just found that out when the tour guide told me.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac squeezed her hand, and she didn’t lean into him. She didn’t reciprocate. “...I saw one of my friends,
        Byakuya. He died. In front of me.”
        <br><br>
        She began shaking, and Obelac gently pulled her into a hug. “....where is he?” she asked.
        “He teleported away,” Hello lied, and Obelac didn’t feel like correcting him would prove fruitful at that
        moment.
        <br><br>
        “How?”
        <br><br>
        He shrugged. “Must’ve been that new Technique he achieved.” Obelac looked at Chinatsu, and she didn’t seem to
        have the energy to contest Hello’s point.
        <br><br>
        “Just take us home…” she said. “Get me far…far…far away from this fucking place…”
        Hello nodded and placed a hand on her’s and Obelac’s shoulders, and a split second later they’d arrive back at
        their home.
        <br><br>
        Once they arrived, Chinatsu just sat down on the couch in the living room and stared at the T.V. Obelac sat down
        beside her, and she just leaned into him. She didn’t speak, she didn’t hold his hand, she just stared at
        nothingness.
        <br><br>
        Obelac didn’t know what to say. He lied to her about KT. He accepted Hello’s lie and didn’t correct him, and he
        was positive Chinatsu must’ve sussed out that Hello was lying, though she didn’t contend with it. He felt like
        shit.
        <br><br>
        The two sat there in silence for a long while, not saying anything at all. The silence was deafening. The
        silence was like a pitch black void that swallowed everything else whole. The blank silence was growing
        deafening, while the woman beside him, the Black Silence, didn’t seem phased in the slightest.
        He supposed then that Silence was where Chinatsu thrived, something that he used to enjoy, but with the weeks
        and months grew intolerant of it. Or rather, its replacement of laughs and smiles. Obelac sighed softly.
        <br><br>
        Right as he was about to get up to do something, anything, his phone cut through the silence like a blade
        through a curse. Obelac swore.
        <br><br>
        “Shit…”
        <br><br>
        He hastily pulled his phone from his pocket, and saw that it was Demon calling. He answered.
        <br><br>
        “Hey..,” she said. Her voice was hoarse, as if she had just been crying. He could guess why. She was as close to
        Dane as he was.
        <br><br>
        “Hey…” he said. “What’s up?”
        <br><br>
        “Have you heard?”
        <br><br>
        “…yeah,” he said. “I…I have…”
        <br><br>
        There was a long pause before Demon spoke again. “I…you need to come down to the Isle,” she said. “There’s an
        emergency meeting about what happened in Tokyo.”
        <br><br>
        “But I thought I was temporarily barred from duties?”
        <br><br>
        “Most of the others are gone from the island on important business,” she said. “Lionel, Brunestud, Glaston,
        Grennick, Laura, and Hayami are gone, leaving just us, Laeticia, Hong Lu, and Larsen.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac groaned. Larsen Hannack-Warthek shared Laeticia’s distaste of him, and was one of the most vocal of those
        against him becoming a Lord. He absolutely didn’t want to be in the same room as him. “Great…where’s my mom and
        Lionel?”
        <br><br>
        “Meeting with the Church,” Demon said. “Urgent stuff. The others are meeting with their contacts too.”
        <br><br>
        “Got it…” Obelac sighed.
        <br><br>
        “Sorry to spring this on you so soon…but…you know how urgent this all is…”
        “I do…” he said. “See you in…ten, then.”
        <br><br>
        “See you,” Demon said, then hung up. Obelac looked at Chinatsu, and she looked at him.
        <br><br>
        “Take me with you,” she said softly, her voice completely absent of energy. “I…don’t wanna be alone”
        <br><br>
        “Yeah…of course…” he assured her. “They’re coming in ten. You can go ahead and refresh yourself. Take as long as
        you need.”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu nodded as she slowly got up and made her way to the bathroom. Obelac slumped down onto the couch. His
        mind raced with so many thoughts that he felt like his brain would explode. Would he have to lie to Demon, too?
        Would he have to not even tell her he saw KT? That Nerd actually killed Dane? That KT was framed? Of course he
        wouldn’t. Not when he didn’t even tell the woman he loved.
        <br><br>
        Obelac felt weak, exhausted. He recalled the last time he felt like that, when his Cursed Energy plummeted and
        he kept getting more and more tired. He chalked it up to him refusing to drink blood, not that he asked anyone
        about it either.
        <br><br>
        He sighed and closed his eyes, and eventually Chinatsu would come back to the living room. She didn’t tie her
        hair up as she usually did. It was down, falling to her shoulders. She wore a white sweater and blue jeans and
        black boots, and had her Yasakani no Magatama necklace on as well. She looked tired despite the shower she just
        took. Obelac got up and soon headed to take a shower as well. Once he entered the bathroom, he undressed,
        stepped inside the shower, and turned the water on as hot as it could go. He stood there for a few minutes as
        the scalding hot water cascaded down his body, and he thought back to everything that happened in this
        unbearably short time frame. Dane was dead, and Nerd turned him into a sword. Tokyo was set ablaze, and then
        frozen by KT. Another Enchanted Blade was made, and another revealed itself, and now there was a meeting between
        the Moonlight Lords. Only five of them.
        <br><br>
        Obelac dried himself off as he took a deep breath. He picked his hair, stretched, and got dressed. He put on a
        red button up with a black tie, black slacks, and red tennis shoes. He looked at himself in the mirror and
        sighed. “Fuck…”
        <br><br>
        He still felt like shit, which was unsurprising. Obelac just wanted to fall into a coma, but duty called
        regardless of his own feelings.
        <br><br>
        Duty, duty, duty. Duty was always calling. Duty was always getting in the way of things. ‘Love is the Death of
        Duty,’ as some have said.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>

        <br>
        When Obelac and Chinatsu arrived at the Isle of Lamia, the Kindred felt that something was off. It was far more
        quiet than usual despite it being night. Nobody was walking around or doing anything. It seemed like a ghost
        town. The one who teleported them, a Kindred Obelac didn’t know the name of, began walking off.
        <br><br>
        “Where’s Demon…?” He asked aloud. The Kindred who brought them there, a young black man around his age, didn’t
        respond. Obelac turned to him. “Hey, you, where is everyone?”
        “Lord Larsen enacted a curfew,” hesaid. “Everyone can’t be out until all the Lords and the Primordial Mother
        return, except for important jobslike mine.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac nodded and sighed as he began to walk toward the meeting hall with Chinatsu behind him. For whatever
        reason he couldn’t pinpoint, his heart was pounding in his chest.
        Chinatsu leaned against Obelac as they walked past the closed vendors and shops, and for a moment she stopped.
        “...What the hell…?” she said aloud.
        <br><br>
        “So it’s not just me…” he muttered, then looked at Chinatsu. “What’s up?”
        <br><br>
        “...give me a moment…” she said after a long pause, glancing at him. Chinatsu bent down on one knee, placing her
        hands atop the stone of the road they walked upon, and closed her eyes. Shadows emitted from her, then thinned
        into tendrils as they began to seep into the ground. Obelac watched this, and after a few seconds Chinatsu’s
        eyes widened in shock. “Shit!” she swore as she stood up.
        <br><br>
        “What’s wrong?” Obelac asked, his heart quickening in his chest. “What did you do?”
        Chinatsu slowly rose up to her feet, and took a deep breath. “I felt an…ominous Cursed Energy signature here,”
        she said. “One that felt like a Nightmare.”
        <br><br>
        “A Nightmare? One’s here?”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu slowly nodded. “Shit…it doesn’t seem to be a new one. It’s been around for a few months at least…you go
        on to the meeting, Obby. I’ll hunt it down-”
        <br><br>
        “-I’m afraid we cannot allow that,” came a voice that made Obelac’s blood boil. He turned and saw Lucius, a
        Second Kindred and one of those who hated him the most. His long, blonde hair glistened in the moonlight, and he
        looked almost ethereal. He wore a purple button up with black slacks and dress shoes, and a rapier was sheathed
        at his hip. He smiled.
        Obelac was positive that normally, he and Chinatsu could take him, but something was off about him. He felt
        different somehow.
        <br><br>
        “You’ve made contact with the Nightmare, haven’t you?” Chinatsu said as she narrowed her eyes. “It gave you some
        kind of power. One that made you stronger.”
        <br><br>
        “You are correct, Black Silence,” Lucius said. “Carmine has blessed me. The fool wishes for me not to kill
        Obelac, but I fear she will have to stop me herself from doing so.”
        <br><br>
        “Why the hell are you doing this?” Obelac spat, narrowing his eyes. “Do you just hate me that fucking much?”
        <br><br>
        Lucius scoffed. “This is not mere hatred, you self-centered brat! This is bettering the future of my people! Of
        making sure a wretch like you doesn’t harm us any further.”
        <br><br>
        “The Nightmare must’ve impaired his thoughts…” Chinatsu muttered as she clenched her fist. “Normally we could
        just beat him awake…but I feel that he’d be better off dead…”
        <br><br>
        “Ma’am, I hope you understand this business has nothing to do with you,” he said. “Though…I know you’re not
        likely to stand down. So-”
        <br><br>
        Lucius was interrupted by a shadow appearing beside him, one that did not belong to Chinatsu. A hand came out
        from the shadow, then another, and soon a humanoid being came out. Lucius did not seem surprised, rather he
        expected it. The being was tall, nearing seven feet in height. They were thin, and wore an expensive blue suit
        and a white fur cape. They had no feet, instead they levitated in the air. Their head was a round, blue,
        see-through sphere with a green liquid inside. In one hand was a conductor’s stick, and a scythe in the other as
        they stood beside Lucius.
        <br><br>
        Obelac never saw this creature before, but Chinatsu’s eyes widened as soon as they spoke.
        <br><br>
        “<strong>Well well…it seems fate has brought us back together, my comrade</strong>~”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu stared at this being before her, and opened her quivering mouth to speak. “...what the hell happened to
        you, Argalia?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac stared at this being, Argalia, and for the first time in his life felt as if he was in mortal danger.
