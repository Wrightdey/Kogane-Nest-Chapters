        <h3>
            The Isle of Lamia, the main home of the Vampires and head seat of their power, had within it a garden dedicated to housing a specific sword. There were no guards watching over it for there was no need. Sheathed within a slab of stone was a golden sword of such brilliant craftsmanship that everything else paled in comparison. It was once wielded by the most well known king in Human history, who with it in his hand was the strongest swordsman in an entire continent.<br><br>

            Obelac looked at the sword, noting its structure. The hilt was made of enchanted gold, and arcane letters were etched into it, the pommel, and the blade itself. The cross-guard had blue details to it. Ocean blue. And at the center was a cross.<br><br>

            Obelac knew that the sword had been stuck in that stone for a thousand years, and that only two people in history had wielded it. The Sword of Promised Victory, one of the Eternal Blades born from a dragon and tempered by the life of a sorcerer. Its name was Excalibur, the strongest sword Obelac had ever seen.<br><br>

            He walked toward it, placing his hand upon the hilt, and slowly wrapped his fingers around it. He pulled, gritting his teeth as he used all the monstrous, yet still suppressed strength that a First Kindred should possess.<br><br>

            It was all for nothing. Obelac sighed as he let go and stepped away. Nerd’s words still rung in his mind all this time later. He thought it was a load of bullshit, but even then it still stuck with him. Nerd to Obelac was the epitome of everything wrong with Jujutsu society. Everything wrong with those in power, with those who possessed wealth. ‘Eat the Rich’, and things of those sorts.<br><br> 

            “Fucking hell…” he sighed. He looked at the blade and bit his lip in frustration.<br><br>

            The only two people in history to have wielded Excalibur were King Arthur Pendragon of Camelot, and Brunestud of the Crimson Moon. The Primogenitor. The Vampire Goddess. The one who slew the Dragon King a millennium ago.<br><br> 

            His mother. One who had betrayed him, one who he had hated, yet also loved. The woman who raised and trained him and showed him how to truly live.<br><br>

            The one he hadn’t seen in years. Who abandoned him. Who didn’t love him. Who forsook their bond for the sake of his strength. Who hadn’t shown her face to him ever since.<br><br>

            Chinatus’s question came back to him. He didn’t hate her. He didn’t want to see her dead, but what he felt was such a strong yet contradictory emotion that ‘hate’ was the only word that he could think of.<br><br>

            He shook his head. <i>Resented</i>. That was a word. He resented her for what she did. Everything she did.<br><br>

            He wondered how such a person could’ve once been worthy to wield Excalibur.<br><br> 

            As he pondered these things Obelac heard footsteps behind him. Turning around he saw a man he absolutely didn’t wish to see. A tall man at around six feet in height with black hair, pale skin, and red eyes. He wore an all black suit and had an air of mystique to him. An air of power. His expression was solemn, almost emotionless. He looked like the archetypal Vampire aristocracy one would see in old movies or television shows.<br><br>

            He was one of the rare people who could be considered ‘Beyond Special Grade’. Alongside Phoebe Morrison of the Church, Kali ‘The Red Mist’ of the Monster Hunters Association, and Kulani of Jujutsu Society. Though of course, those such as Liv and BR could be considered on that level as well. He possessed two Cursed Techniques: Moon Manipulation and Cursed Spirit Manipulation. Having been in action since the Golden Age, he was sired by Brunestud herself.<br><br>

            His name was Lionel Harlow--a First Kindred--and the closest thing on this planet Obelac had to a brother.<br><br>

            “What causes you to try,” he asked. Obelac didn’t want to answer, but felt that he had to.<br><br>

            “I was curious.’<br><br>

            “Curious,” he repeated, questioning. Obelac nodded. Lionel walked toward him, reaching out to take the sword in hand. He pulled, yet it didn’t budge an inch.<br><br>

            He chuckled. “There goes my curiosity…”<br><br> 

            Obelac was admittedly surprised. He had at least expected Lionel to be worthy of wielding Excalibur. The man turned to him, looking him over. “Now, enough of that,” he said. “Why haven’t you done it yet?”<br><br>

            Obelac blinked. “...huh?”<br><br> 

            “I can sense you haven’t supped on blood,” he said. “You’re weak. Pathetically weak for a First Kindred.”<br><br>

            “So what,” he said, his eyes narrowing. “I don’t want to.”<br><br>

            “Do you fear that doing so will make you less human?”<br><br>

            Obelac didn’t answer, and Lionel stepped closer toward him. Obelac tensed, and the older Kindred looked him in the eyes, noting the brown hidden behind his glasses.<br><br>

            “Why do you hate me,” Lionel asked him.<br><br>

            Obelac was taken aback by this. “Wha-”<br><br>

            “Why do you hate me,” he repeated.<br><br>

            “I…don’t hate you,” he said.<br><br>

            “Then what do you feel about me?”<br><br>

            “I don’t know.”<br><br>

            “You do. You simply don’t want to speak.”<br><br>

            Obelac sighed heavily. “...I’m jealous,” he said.”That mo…that Brunestud likes you more than me.”<br><br>

            He expected Lionel to chastise him. To demean or belittle him or even strike him. But he didn’t.<br><br>

            He laughed. “Now, now, that’s quite humorous,” he said, doubling over as tears welled in his eyes. “Ah…I apologzie…but that’s simply rich…”<br><br> 

            Obelac stared at him, confused out of his mind. “...huh?”<br><br>

            Lionel caught his breath and slowly stood up straight. “Ah…I apologize,” he chuckled. “It’s…simply...you truly do think less of yourself. Obelac, Brunestud loves you-”<br><br>

            “-Bullshit,” he said, and his eyes would widen as he realized just what he said. He felt his hands shake as those words left his lips.<br><br>

            “Oh? How so,” Lionel asked. “Elaborate. Tell me why.”<br><br> 

            “How could she not? She abandoned me! Left me! Made me into a fucking vampire! And for what?! To make me stronger?”<br><br>

            Each question was met with a more loud, pained, and demanding tone. Lionel looked at Obelac as he panted, fists clenched.<br><br>

            He sat down on a tree stump and looked up at Obelac. “I see…” he said. “Do you know how she met me?”<br><br>

            “Does it matter?”<br><br>

            “Yes,” he said. “In actuality, she met me first when I was a child. I was…the son of someone she was involved with, and after my father died she took me in. Raised me like her son. Then turned me.”<br><br>

            “So?”<br><br>

            “So, you must imagine how shocked I was when, after not seeing her for centuries, she had done the exact same thing to another young child.”<br><br>

            Obelac stared at him for a little while and Lionel continued. “I at first felt bitter,” he admitted. “I believed what you believed about me. That she no longer viewed me as her sired Kindred. Her son. I at first didn’t want to have you be a Moonlight Lord, and me accepting you into the rank was argued by everyone other than Demon.”<br><br>

            “...what,” Obelac asked, genuinely taken aback at what he said.<br><br>

            “To what part,” he asked wryly. “It is true. I was resentful of you. I initially saw you as…as mother trying to start again. Trying to replace me. I didn’t see you as a threat to my power, but rather as a threat to my identity. Another me, but more…hateful. Lost. Conflicted.”<br><br>

            Obelac sat down on another stump, Excalibur behind him. “And…why did the others not want me to join?”<br><br>

            “Because, frankly speaking, you’re weak,” he said. “When it comes to Jujutsu Sorcerers, yes, you’re strong. But that is only due to your status as a first Kindred. Demon is a third Kindred and exists as the fourth strongest Sorcerer in the planet. Demon possesses two Cursed Techniques, while you possess none. There are other Vampires stronger than you who are not a part of the council. Yet despite that, you were chosen due to your status as a first Kindred. Because the rules of Filial Piety deemed it so.”<br><br> 

            “...I’m weak,” he repeated, clasping his hands together.<br><br>

            “As long as you hide yourself, yes. You are,” Lionel told him. “You wear those glasses to hide your eyes, and you still refuse to drink blood.”<br><br>

            “Because it’s disgusting!” he said, his voice raising before he even realized it. Lionel looked down at him, then sighed.<br><br>

            “It may seem that way to you…” he said softly. “But you will have to make that decision soon enough.”<br><br>

            “And if I don't?”<br><br>

            “Then you’ll never grow. You’ll remain as you are as everyone surpasses you,” Lionel said. “Do you want that?”<br><br>

            Obelac looked down at the ground and shook his head. “I don’t.”<br><br>

            “Then you’ll simply have to,” he said. “Just know, if you need help I’ll be for you, little brother.”<br><br>

            Obelac, for whatever reason he couldn’t perceive or understand, felt his heart twinge as he heard those words.<br><br> 

            “Alright…thanks…” he said. The final part of what he wished to tell him died before it left his mouth.<br><br>
