        <h3>
            Obelac groaned as he slowly woke up. The way the sunlight shone into the room and across his face annoyed
            him and made him cover his face. For a moment he thought he was in his own bed. That was until he realized
            that the bed he was in was far too large to be his own, and that someone clung onto him. He looked down and
            embarrassment filled him as he saw Chinatsu sleeping next to him. He noticed she was naked, and right after
            that he noticed that he was also naked. The memories of last night and the day before began flooding his
            mind all at once. How he had drunk her blood, how he had tasted more than he thought he would, and how they
            had gone back to her home after she had closed shop. He recalled how they touched each other and held each
            other close. He recalled how good she smelled and tasted, and just how beautiful she really was.<br><br>

            He felt desires stir within him as he recollected these things. Obelac sighed as he carefully pulled away
            from Chinatsu and stood up. He found his undergarments thrown half haphazardly onto the floor and put them
            on. <br><br>

            Chinatsu’s room was large. A cursory glance showed that she had not much to fill it other than basic
            amenities and a bookshelf filled with history and mythology books. He could make out works like
            <i>Beowulf</i> and <i>Gawain and the Green Knight</i>. There were numerous books about Heian Era Japan, and
            Japanese myths and legends on her shelf as well, alongside the occasional collection of myths and legends
            from European countries like Germany and England. His eyes continued to wander, and he saw an opened book on
            her dresser. He headed over to it and picked it up. <br><br>

            The book was about vampires, specifically their basic biological functions and their history. A cursory
            glance showed it to be fairly accurate. It detailed how Brunestud was their progenitor, and how they as a
            culture worked. Basic tenants like Filial Piety were explained, as well as the Moonlight Lords. Obelac
            couldn’t help but notice however that he wasn’t included in the list provided, and when he checked the
            publishing date, it was before he had joined them officially. He sighed and placed it back down.<br><br>

            “Someone’s nosey,” he heard from behind him. His heart thumped as he heard Chinatsu’s voice and he turned to
            her. She sat up in the bed, the sheets covered her lower half as she looked at him. “Good morning,” she
            smiled.<br><br>

            Obelac couldn’t take his eyes off her. Her hair was messy, but the fact only made her more beautiful in his
            eyes. His eyes wandered over her body and she only smiled as she watched him. <br><br>

            “Good morning,” he said, embarrassed. “How are you?” <br><br>

            “Amazing,” she said as she slowly rose from the bed. She didn’t even try to cover herself unlike him, and he
            felt the sudden urge to look away, but he didn’t. He kept looking at her as she approached him. He had
            remembered when he compared her to a wrestler or a boxer, but now his opinion changed entirely. Currently,
            Obelac thought Chinatsu to be like Artemeis or Athena, or perhaps more fittingly Bellona. To him she looked
            like a goddess of war. She was more built than him, a physique born from hard work and trials. He also saw
            scars across her body. Some on her stomach, her back, scars that even Reverse Curse Technique couldn’t heal.
            <br><br>

            Her hair framed her face beautifully, her black eyes filled with warmth as she came close to Obelac. He
            could still smell her scent, and his own on her, and that drove him mad. Everything about this drove him
            mad. If he had been like he was two days ago, this would have been more bearable, but his newfound senses
            made everything far more intimate. From the moment he drank Chinatsu’s blood he signed himself to a better
            understanding of the world around him. He could smell everything, hear everything. He could hear their
            hearts pounding and smell her scent. He could feel the warmth of her skin against his and that drove him
            mad. <br><br>

            Chinatsu would press her lips against his and his eyes widened in surprise, but he’d soon ease into it as he
            held onto her. He loved this. He loved being with her and never wanted to leave her. <br><br>

            The two lovers stayed like this, embraced in each other's arms and tasting each other until they eventually
            pulled back to breathe. Obelac wanted more, but had to remind himself that his wants weren’t the only thing
            that mattered. <br><br>

            “I’ll make us something to eat,” Chinatsu told him. “In the meantime, you can take a shower and get
            dressed.” Obelac nodded and she’d move to scrounge up her undergarments off the floor. <br><br>

            Obelac entered the bathroom and tried to take a look at himself in the mirror only to be met with nothing.
            He had forgotten that would happen upon him drinking blood. Mirrors for vampires existed as Cursed Tools,
            and Obelac would have to invest in getting a couple for his own and Chinatsu’s homes. Chinatsu’s bathroom
            was another example of the opulence of her home. The walls were a white marble, as was the sink. The bathtub
            and shower were as well. Chinatsu had a lot of hair products placed neatly on a shelf beside the sink, and
            Obelac realized that he’d have to use her bodywash for the time being. <br><br>

            He placed his clothes on the toilet lid alongside his underwear and turned on the shower. There were a lot
            of buttons, the functions of which he had no idea the purpose of, and prayed that he’d simply turn it on as
            normal. He was hit with a blast of hot water and a sigh of relief left his lips. He basked in the warmth,
            the dried sweat and other fluids washed off him as he closed his eyes. <br><br>

            He was a fully fledged vampire now. It would take him a while to fully understand the weight of all that. He
            knew that now his strength would grow, as his senses had already begun to. He knew he might develop the Moon
            Manipulation Cursed Technique all vampires had the potential to grow. He knew that he would need to take on
            more responsibilities as a Moonlight Lord. He knew all of these changes, but had no idea the toll they could
            have on him. <br><br>

            The water droplets that poured onto the floor beneath him was the only sound that occupied his mind. Obelac
            needed to try and embrace this aspect of himself, because there was no other way for him to deny it any
            longer. He was a full fledged vampire. He couldn’t hide as a human any longer. He would need to let his
            identity be known to Dane, Hello, Liv, and every other Sorcerer. He needed to come clean to them for his
            years of lies. <br><br>

            Obelac would finish up in the bathroom. As he dried himself off and put his clothes on, he would notice his
            phone was ringing. He picked it up and saw that it was Demon. <br><br>

            “Yeah?” he answered. <br><br>

            “There’s a meeting today,” she told him. “Between the Moonlight Lords. If it’s last minute and you can’t
            come, I get it. It’s really annoying me that they sprung it up on us. But then if you don’t come…well I
            guess I can survive just fine by myself with a bunch of old people.” <br><br>

            “Old people,” he laughed. “That’s no way to talk about those ranked older than you.” <br><br>

            “Yeah yeah, they’re not here to hear it.” <br><br>

            “So you won’t say it to their face, then.” <br><br>

            He heard her laugh over the phone. “Of course not! I gotta act like the calm, reasonable, boring liaison
            after all. Can’t go and start acting all cheery.” <br><br>

            “Yeah, sure,” Obelac teased.<br><br>

            “Now now…don’t make me throw you through another training lesson,” she said, much more like a threat than a
            warning. <br><br>

            “Of course, sorry,” he replied hastily.<br><br>

            Demon laughed again, and Obelac sighed. “I’ll send someone to pick you up. You’re at home, right?” <br><br>

            There was a long pause after Demon’s question. “No,” Obelac said. <br><br>

            “Then where are you?” <br><br>

            It took him longer to respond. “...Chinatsu’s hou-”<br><br>

            He couldn’t even finish before Demon’s laughter nearly broke his phone’s audio devices. The laughter he
            heard through his device was like that of a mad scientist who had finally uncovered what drove them down
            their journey to begin with. <br><br>

            “You did it, didn’t you? You fuc-”<br><br>

            “Pick us up in three hours, bye,” he said as he hung up on her immediately. Obelac groaned, placing his
            phone down as he put his clothes on. <br><br>

            Obelac entered the kitchen, the smell of bacon and eggs making him drool. Much like other parts of her home,
            Chinatsu’s kitchen was taken right out of a mansion. The stove was electric, and she had pots and pans that
            hung above it. She had a knife block placed atop a marble counter, and a juicer beside it. Chinatsu was
            dressed in a black tank top and blue jean shorts. Her hair was tied up as well. She turned to him and
            smiled. She scooped the bacon and eggs onto a plate and placed them onto a kitchen table as she sat down.
            Obelac sat down across from her as they began to eat. <br><br>

            “So, what’s the plan for today,” she asked him. <br><br>

            He began to eat his scrambled eggs as he looked across to her. “I have to go in for a meeting,” he told her.
            “Vampire stuff.” <br><br>

            The face she gave made Obelac think she was disappointed at that. <br><br>

            “Got it…” she said, picking at her food.<br><br>

            “You can come with me if you want,” he told her. <br><br>

            “Really,” she asked with a smile. <br><br>

            “Of course,” he said. “I’d have to introduce you to them all eventually anyway…” <br><br>

            Chinatsu began eating her food in earnest, and he sent Demon a quick text. <br><br>

            <i>“Make it one hour.”</i><br>

            <br>
            <hr><br>

            Obelac and Chinatsu landed in the Isle of Lamia thanks to the teleportation Cursed Technique of a lower
            Kindred. It was still daytime and the two had a while before the meeting officially started.<br><br>

            Obelac wanted to show her around, but that plan was shot dead in its tracks as soon as he saw Demon, a smirk
            on her face as she looked the two over.<br><br>

            “Hey, Obelac, Chinatsu,” she said.<br><br>

            Obelac said nothing in response, but Chinatsu smiled. “Hey. Demon, right?” <br><br>

            “Yup,” she said. “So, how are you two doing? I can’t help but notice you two smell the exact same, so I take
            it-”<br><br>

            “-I’ll let you two get to know each other, I have stuff to do,” he said as he gently pushed Chinatsu toward
            Demon, completely and utterly embarrassed. The two women giggled as they watched the First Kindred head off
            to cool down. <br><br>

            Obelac walked down to the grove where Excalibur was held. It was surrounded by trees that stretched high
            into the sky and provided ample shade for any Kindred who weren’t impervious to the sun or didn’t have
            Cursed Tools to help provide a temporary immunity.<br><br>

            He took in the fresh air as a sense of calmness washed over him. His heart was steady, and he’d only feel
            more embarrassed at his outburst the more level headed he got. He had realized more and more in that moment
            that he was a very confrontational person. <br><br>

            He looked back on what he had felt just the day before. He didn’t know KT, but he hated him. He didn’t know
            Africa, but he hated him. He didn’t truly know Lionel either and he hated him just the same. He wondered
            just who else had he unjustly hated. Nerd, or maybe other Sorcerers like Ren? He shook his head as he
            decided to deal with those thoughts later. <br><br>

            As Obelac walked forward, he stopped in his tracks as soon as he saw someone in the distance. In front of
            the sheathed Excalibur stood a woman who seemed at a glance to be around eight feet in height. She was
            dressed in a long, all white sundress that fell down just above her ankles and wore a pair of black heels.
            Her skin was as pale as the moon, and in the sunlight she looked more like a ghost or even a figment of his
            imagination. She had long, braided black hair that fell down to the middle of her back. <br><br>

            He compared Chinatsu to a goddess, and to him that was the most accurate word that could describe her. With
            regards to the woman before him, however, this was an entirely different matter. To Obelac, the word
            ‘goddess’ could not be used to describe her. To him a goddess was still something that a human, or even a
            mortal for that matter, could attain. The woman that stood in front of him was beyond what even the most
            powerful Cursed Spirit or vampire could become. She was like a force of nature, night incarnate. Whereas
            Chinatsu was like Bellona or Artemis, this woman could be compared to no other than Nyx herself. <br><br>

            She turned around, and her red vampiric eyes bore into Obelac’s. Her lips were a blood red, and her face had
            signs of age despite her supposed eternal youth. Though to anyone else she might have looked to be in her
            thirties, someone like Obelac could make out the small details. The exhaustion and weariness that showed on
            her face, or the tired look behind her eyes.<br><br>

            He felt his knees shake as he fully took in her appearance, and felt his heart beat in his chest with
            emotions he both hadn’t felt and emotions he always felt. Love, hate, wanting, longing, resentment, wrath,
            anger, sorrow, despair, all of these things surged through the innermost parts of his being. His mouth grew
            dry as the woman turned around fully, her towering form loomed over him. <br><br>

            Memories of a childhood he both cherished and cursed flashed through his mind. Springs spent training,
            winters spent huddled against a fireplace reading stories and drinking chocolate, summers spent fishing and
            playing, autumns spent exploring and experiencing what the world had to offer. From the moment he first
            learned to use Cursed Energy to the moment he had become a vampire, all of these things rushed to his mind
            as he saw her. Eight years worth of memories burst forth and nearly made him fall to the floor. <br><br>

            His eyes watered and his mouth quivered, and the one word he wished he never said left his lips. “...Mom?”
