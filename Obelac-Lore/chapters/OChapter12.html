        The law of Filial Piety was the end all be all for a Vampire. It was a divine decree established by Brunestud
        herself during the Golden Age, a decree for those she had accepted as family. They were to protect eachother and
        obey the orders of their superiors, of those higher in the bloodstream. Second Kindred were to obey First
        Kindred, and all were to obey the Great Progenitor.
        <br><br>
        Lucius was the Kindred of a Vampire who had died long ago during the end of the Golden Age, whose name was
        Fulgur. Brunestud had originally sired fifty Kindred during the Golden Age, and these fifty would become the
        forebearers for the Vampires that were alive today. These fifty bloodlines were the most influential and the
        most powerful, and most Kindred who possessed great strength came from these fifty First Kindred. All of these
        fifty, save Lionel, were dead by now, slain over the years by those false warriors of the Church or through
        rebellion or other means.
        <br><br>
        Lucius was the last son of Fulgur, and though he had Kindred of his own, he was by far the strongest of the
        bloodstream. His Kindred were weak, frail, and adverse to combat. They fancied themselves visionaries and
        artists, and would be more likely to run from conflict than defend themselves.
        <br><br>
        Lucius held two Cursed Techniques: Moon Manipulation and Bone Manipulation. He was a fairly powerful Kindred,
        more powerful than most others, yet he was not chosen to be a part of the Moonlight Lords. He did not know why
        in the slightest. He watched as more and more members were hand picked by Lionel over the course of five hundred
        years. He could understand why Lionel’s Kindred, Glaston and Grennick were chosen, for they were Lionel’s
        trusted aides and comrades. He could understand why Laeticia was chosen, for she was a queen and knew of ruling.
        He even understood why Demon Akitsuha and Hayami were chosen for they both knew the mentalities and secrets of
        Jujutsu Sorcerers, but for the life of him he could not understand why Hong Lu and Laura were chosen, let alone
        Obelac. Hong Lu was a Third Kindred, though unlike Demon he never took anything seriously. He always had a false
        smile on his face despite what he knew the Kindred experienced before he was turned. He knew Hong Lu was the
        last child of a Chinese Sorcerer Clan that had been exterminated by the rabid hunting dog of Jujutsu Society
        known as Kulani. He knew Hong Lu experienced the Taiping Rebellion and witnessed the deaths of thirty million
        humans. He knew all that, yet the man still wore his detestable smile.
        <br><br>
        Laura was barely older than Obelac, being a mere seventy years of age. She was also a Fifth Kindred, someone so
        down on the bloodstream that she wasn’t impervious to sunlight and needed a Cursed Tool to operate for extended
        durations of time. She was young, though experienced he had to admit, but still young all the same.
        <br><br>
        And then, there was Obelac. Lucius viewed him as the absolute stain of his society. He was only taken as a part
        of the Lords due to him being sired by Brunestud. He had no experience, no talent, and hadn’t even unlocked his
        Cursed Technique. He had struck the Great Progenitor, directly violating the law of Filial Piety in the process,
        and yet Lucius was sure that he would only get a slap on the wrist.
        <br><br>
        Obelac was the manifestation of everything that was wrong with the law of Filial Piety. Lucius had to obey him,
        had to do his bidding simply because he was higher up the bloodstream. It didn’t matter if Obelac had barely
        even existed for two decades, a being of several centuries like Lucius still had to obey him. Even if Lucius was
        stronger, he still had to obey.
        <br><br>
        The Vampires needed only one First Kindred, Lionel. Lionel was strong, intelligent, and guided them for a
        thousand years. His lineage was filled with intelligent and powerful Kindred, and he possessed enough strength
        to combat both the Church and the Monster Hunters if he needed. Lionel had been their King since Brunestud had
        abandoned them, and with her back Lucius feared she would take control as befitted the law of Filial Piety.
        Lucius didn’t believe Brunestud was fit to rule. She was too attached to Obelac, too wild and too emotional. She
        was their Goddess, and he reveared her, but he believed she would not be able to lead them in the current era of
        shadow wars and secrecy as she had when they could be more proud.
        <br><br>
        Lucius believed that a change had to be in order, to ensure their people could prosper. To ensure that Obelac or
        those Kindred who harbored hatred for their own people wouldn’t bring them to ruin.
        <br><br>
        To Lucius, even if he had to die, the solution was simple. The law of Filial Piety had to be reformed. He
        deserved to be on the council of the Moonlight Lords, not Obelac. He deserved it far more than that child did.
        <br><br>
        Such a thought was tantamount to treason, yet he thought it all the same. Things needed to change, taboos needed
        to be broken, and Obelac…needed to die for those things to happen. He needed to die. He symbolized everything
        wrong with Vampire society. He would rather converse with humans and sorcerers instead of his own people. He
        would rather bed a human, a Monster Hunter at that, than care about his own people. The fact that someone like
        him had power was an insult to every vampire that breathed, and for that he had to die. For his existence he had
        to die.
        <br><br>
        Obelac had to die.
        <br><br>
        Obelac had to die.
        <br><br>
        Obelac, the First Kindred, had to die.
        <br><br>
        Obelac, the seventh strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer, had to die.
        <br><br>
        Obelac, the favored son of Brunestud, had to die.
        <br><br>
        Obelac, the lover of the Black Silence, had to die.
        <br><br>
        “Obelac, the one I have my eye on, has to die?”
        <br><br>
        Lucius turned to the voice that had spoken to him and to his surprise saw a woman. She seemed human, but the air
        she gave off was more of a Cursed Spirit. She had black hair and red eyes, and she wore a white dress coat with
        a black button up shirt and a white skirt. She stood beside Lucius.
        <br><br>
        “Who are you,” he demanded. The woman turned to him and smiled.
        <br><br>
        “My name is Carmine,” she said, her voice smooth like velvet, “And I will help you, Lucius. You interest me.”
        <br><br>
        “Intrest you? Enough of this, identify yourself properly. What are you, woman?”
        The woman named Carmine placed her hand on Lucius’ shoulder only for it to phase through. He raised a brow at
        this.
        <br><br>
        “I am a helper for all,” she said. “All I wish to do is to allow others to find out the truth about themselves.
        To be able to access the innermost truth of their beings. To bring out their powers.”
        <br><br>
        “You…are no Cursed Spirit,” he said. “Why should I follow you? Why should I trust you? I may not be able to
        touch you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t kill you.”
        <br><br>
        Carmine gave a warm, motherly smile. “Lucius, you do not have a choice,” she said calmly. “Just…allow me to sink
        into your soul…”
        <br><br>
        Carmine suddenly placed her hand through Lucius’ chest, and his eyes would roll back into his head.
        <br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>

        Obelac stood before the Moonlight Lords for the crime of breaking the edict of Filial Piety in attacking the
        Great Progenitor, Brunestud of the Crimson Moon. The faces of those who stood to judge him varied. Some, like
        Hayami and Laura, seemed to be understanding. Others like Grennick and Glaston seemed more relaxed. Hong Lu had
        his perpetual smile, Larsen looked at Obelac, Demon seemed a little nervous, and Lionel had a blank expression.
        The person who seemed most annoyed and angered was Laeticia, someone Obelac felt genuinely despised him.
        <br><br>
        Laeticia was dressed in a regal black and red dress, one that made him remember that she used to be genuine
        royalty before she became a vampire centuries ago. Laeticia was the archetypal example of aristocratic vampire
        beauty. She had an air of superiority and she was constantly sticking her nose up at others like she was better
        than they were. “Obelac,” she announced. “You are on trial for disobeying the edict of Filial Piety. Normally, I
        would ask how you plead, but that shall not be necessary. Your plea means nothing, when it is known fact what
        you did. Obeying the laws of the Great Progenitor is of utmost importance, and breaking them is deserving of a
        harsh sentence.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac was sure he wouldn’t face any genuine consequences. Brunestud wouldn’t let him die, neither would Lionel,
        Hong Lu, Demon, or Laura. He wouldn’t care if he was kicked out, and he was sure he wouldn’t be either.
        <br><br>
        Laeticia looked at him, her eyes narrowed as she continued. “Normally, I would have you ejected from our ranks
        and exiled from our lands, but you have been vouched for. Lionel came up with an alternate punishment for you.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac kept looking at her, bored out of his mind. He was sure whatever the punishment was, he would be able to
        handle it.
        <br><br>
        “You will be temporarily ejected from the rank of the Moonlight Lords, whereupon you will operate under me, as
        my assistant. By decree of the senior First Kindred, and a ruling accepted by the Great Progenitor, you are to
        obey my words to the letter. You are not to talk back or disobey. You are to learn under me, and learn how to
        grow into your role. There will be no other options, and to deny this will result in your being banished from
        your role entirely and in perpetuity.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac stared blankly at her. That was the absolute last thing he wanted, but he didn’t have any choice either
        so he simply nodded.
        <br><br>
        “I’m glad you understand,” she said, and Obelac could hear the smugness in her voice. “This trial will be
        adjurned, however you must stay behind.”
        <br><br>
        As the other Lords rose from their seats and left, the two would be soon left behind. Obelac looked at Laeticia,
        his eyes narrowed as she approached. She looked him over. “Why did you accept?”
        <br><br>
        “Excuse me?”
        <br><br>
        “You may think you’re clever or secretive, but it’s obvious what you think of me. Of your people. You hate us,
        don’t you?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac stared at her, unable to formulate any smart or snide retort, and so simply told her the truth. “...I
        don’t know.”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia raised her brow. “What do you mean you don’t know?”
        <br><br>
        “I mean, I don’t know,” he told her.
        <br><br>
        “Do you hate me?”
        <br><br>
        “...Yes,” he admitted. “...but I probably did for unjust reasons…”
        <br><br>
        Obelac’s words genuinely surprised Laeticia. She folded her arms as she looked at him. “I will be honest as
        well, then. I hate you. I hate you for reasons I believe to be just. I hate the disregard you have toward your
        people. I hate the fact that you treat your duties as a Moonlight Lord with distaste, and have shown no
        initiative in learning or doing more. I hate you yet I tolerate you, for that is the edict of Filial Piety. But
        now…with you under my wing, I will train you to be a Vampire worthy of your station.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac simply nodded.
        <br><br>
        “Good,” she said. “I do not wish to continue to hate you, please prove me right in trying to help.”
        <br><br>
        He nodded once more, and she headed off. Obelac followed her.
        <br><br>
        The Isle of Lamia was separated into various different districts. Acting as the central home for all Vampires,
        it was akin to a city state in the age before the modern era. They were entirely self-sufficient. They made
        their own homes, their own technologies, produced their own everyday items, and if they needed exports, Lionel
        would handle it. The Moonlight Lords with the exception of Obelac and Demon had plots of land to themselves
        where they and their Kindred resided. Other vampires resided in the areas designated to their original sire.
        Those of the lineage of the same First Kindred would all live in the same area, though it was possible for
        Kindred to move to other sections if they so desired.
        <br><br>
        Laeticia had led Obelac to her portion of the isle. The two would pass an ornate silver gate that led to a stone
        path. Up ahead was a large villa that was surrounuded by several other homes of varying architectural styles.
        Obelac’s eyes widened in genuine amazement at what he saw. The villa was rustic in appearance, something Obelac
        figured he’d have seen in a place like Italy. The buildings surrounding it varied from late Ottoman or
        French-Gothic styles, to more modern American, classical Greek, and even brutalist styles.
        <br><br>
        The Second Kindred led Obelac into her villa. The inside was well lit. The floor was made of oak, and as she led
        him into the kitchen, Obelac would notice standard cooking appliances. They would pass butlers and maids who
        were all performing their own duties, and Obelac had hoped she wouldn’t make him join their ranks. They
        eventually stopped in front of a set of twin dark oak doors, and as Laeticia opened them and lead him inside,
        Obelac noticed they were in a study. There were bookshelves pressed against nearly every single wall, alongside
        a large mahogany desk stacked high with papers. There was also a closed laptop atop the desk as well.
        <br><br>
        “This is my study,” Laeticia told him. “And where you will meet me every day at twelve on the dot. A.M, of
        course. Unlike you, most modern vampires cannot survive for long in sunlight.”
        <br><br>
        “Will I have to stay here?”
        <br><br>
        “No, I will have arrangements for you to teleport here as needed,” she said. “When you arrive, I will have a
        list of tasks you will do. Understood?”
        <br><br>
        He nodded.
        <br><br>
        “Use your words while you’re under me.”
        <br><br>
        “...I got it,” he said.
        <br><br>
        “Good. You may now leave.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac nodded, turned, then left.
        <br><br>

            <br><i>Interlude: Chinatsu Zenin
                <br>
                ~The Black Silence~
            </i>
        </div>

        <br><br>
        Throughout history, humanity had only a few natural predators. The first and most numerous were Cursed Spirits,
        beings born from the negative emotions of non sorcerers. The second most prominent were those beings born from
        the Cursed Realm, Nightmares. Of course other monsters existed as well, but were either too rare to encounter or
        too recent to take note of. Vampires only existed for around two thousand years. Sea Monsters were rare and
        dwindled down over the years due to the efforts of Chinatsu’s senior co worker, the Indigo Elder. Demons were
        all but wiped out with only a few stragglers hiding in the shadows, and their existences were more similar to
        Cursed Spirits and Nightmares than the Demons of Christian faith. Werewolves were a species that dwindled in
        numbers as well due to excessive hunting.
        <br><br>
        Nightmares, in Chinatsu’s honest opinion, were more dangerous than Cursed Spirits. Only non sorcerers and curse
        users could birth them, however anyone could bring forth a Nightmare. Any sapient being that dreamed and had
        nightmares were capable of producing them. They possessed Cursed Techniques based upon what dream they were
        birthed from. Their physical makeup allowed them to regenerate using their own Cursed Energy reserves, much like
        a Cursed Spirit, and much like them, Reverse Curse Technique harmed Nightmares as well. Nightmares could also
        haunt someone, much like Curses, but only those used to their presence could fully detect them. Nightmares could
        hide in someone’s dreams to haunt and manipulate them. In rare cases, a Nightmare could cause a person to
        undergo a process called Distortion, which would temporarily turn that person into a nightmare. Chinatsu saw
        that process only two times. Once when she first became a Color, when she had to kill them to prevent them from
        harming anyone else, and the other two months ago.
        <br><br>
        There was a way to find out if someone had unknowingly produced a Nightmare. The usual symptoms were
        sluggishness, irritability, and temporary narcolepsy. One could also notice if the victim has a lower amount of
        Cursed Energy than usual. It wasn’t an insignificant amount that would be lost, and the more Cursed Energy that
        was lost, the more powerful the Nightmare would be.
        <br><br>
        There was another way still, one that only Chinatsu could do via her Cursed Technique. She could link her own
        shadow with the person that produced the Nightmare, and in doing so their two shadows would meld into the shape
        of the Nightmare formed. This was what led Chinatsu to where she was now, hunting down the Nightmare formed by
        one of her few friends in the Zenin clan, Kyoko.
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu was running across the Tokyo rooftops. The moon was high yet despite that people were still out and
        about. The Nightmare she faced was familiar, disturbingly familiar. They were a man, a tall man with choppy
        brown hair and brown eyes. They wore a black and blue yukata with sandals and a katana at their side. Their name
        was Fuji Zenin, a member of the Kukuro Unit. They were pathetically weak, and the only reason they weren’t dead
        yet was Chinatsu trying to figure out why they of all people produced such a reaction from Kyoko.
        <br><br>
        Kyoko had always been timid. Her father was a member of the Akashi unit, and her mother was a simple handmaiden
        until she died a few years ago. Kyoko didn’t inherit any Cursed Technique, so she was discarded by her father
        and was brought up alongside Chinatsu. Kyoko was the kindest person she knew, though she rarely saw her anymore
        because of her job.
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu came closer to the Nightmare, and she could smell its fear in the air as it kept hurrying away from
        her. With a sudden burst of Cursed Energy she leapt through the air and soared into the sky. Chinatsu would
        gracefully land in front of the Nightmare that wore Fuji’s face, and with little effort she slammed them into
        the ground. It let out a scream of pure agony as its bones audibly cracked. Chinatsu narrowed her eyes as she
        grabbed it by the hair and slammed its face into the rooftop. It let out another pained scream, and she began to
        speak.
        <br><br>
        “What are you,” she asked coldly. The Nightmare tried to escape her iron tight grasp, and when it found out it
        couldn’t, it began wailing.
        <br><br>
        “I-I-It’s n-n-not m-m-my fault I’m like this!” it said. Nightmares who were based off a living person had a
        fifty fifty chance of gaining their own personality, or mimicking that of the person they look like. It appeared
        that this Nightmare was the latter. She never knew Fuji to be a coward.
        <br><br>
        “Answer me and I’ll let you live,” she lied. “What do you represent? Why is Kyoko scared of you?”
        <br><br>
        The Nightmare refused to speak. It simply mumbled out words as it began to cry. Chinatsu slammed its head once
        more into the rooftop. Blood flew into the air and onto her clothes as its nose cracked and its lip burst. Its
        jaw was broken as well, yet it still sobbed. “I-I-I-I..h-he…h-he…”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu felt her heart surge in a combination of fury and helplessness as her anger slowly got the best of her.
        Her Cursed Energy swelled as she pulled its head by its hair and stared it in the eyes. “...fine then,” she
        said. “I won’t need you anyway…”
        <br><br>
        “WAIT!” it screamed out. “H-he bullied her! That’s why! Just leave me alone, I only look like him!”
        <br><br>
        She let go of its hair. Chinatsu slowly stood up and wiped the blood off her. The Nightmare had a look of relief
        on its face. “Thank you! Thank you so mu-”
        <br><br>
        “-Divine Dog.”
        <br><br>
        The Nightmare’s words of appreciation soon turned into screams as the Divine Dogs began to tear it apart. The
        pulled at opposite sides, its arms and legs were getting torn from its torso, and with a visceral scrunch, the
        Nightmare remained nothing but a stump. The dogs began eating its arms and legs, satisfied with the treat
        Chinatsu gave them. The woman looked down at it coldly as it sobbed and screamed in pain. This thing was not
        human, nor did it deserve any kindness. She knew that Nightmares, even if they developed their own personality,
        would sooner or later succumb to the origin point of their existence. The fear that brought them to life would
        become their purpose for living.
        <br><br>
        “You’re pathetic,” she said. The Nightmare looked up at her, its face a mess as it sobbed and begged for mercy
        she would not give. As the dogs ate its limbs, she placed her boot atop its head. “Beg, and I’ll let you live,”
        she said. Her voice was shaky and her heart beated with fury in her chest. She knew how Zenin men could be
        toward younger members of their clan. She knew, but never thought that…
        <br><br>
        She stepepd down harder on its head in a visceral response to the conclusion that her mind made, whether it was
        true or not. The Nightmare screamed out as its tears began flooding from its red eyes. Chinatsu clenched her
        fists. “Beg,” she repeated. She was no longer talking to a Nightmare, that fact had vanished from her mind. In
        front of her was Fuji, the man who hurt her friend. “Beg forgiveness. Confess.”
        <br><br>
        “I-I-I’m sorry for what he-”
        <br><br>
        She stepped harder.
        <br><br>
        “I’m sorry for what I did! I’m sorry I did that to her!”
        <br><br>
        “What did you do?”
        <br><br>
        “I…I..”
        <br><br>
        “Confess.”
        <br><br>
        “I…I…I…he was-I was pent up and-”
        <br><br>
        There would be no further words from it. Chinatsu with little effort crushed its head to a pulp beneath her
        boot. Blood and viscera sprayed everywhere, and brain matter got on her pants.
        “....”
        <br><br>
        She was breathing heavily, her heart pounded in her chest as she processed what it had said, and tears would
        form in her eyes as the weight of what happened to Kyoko finally settled.
        <br><br>
        She thought back to a conversation she had with Obelac, of if he hated his mother. To her, hate was a word
        reserved for someone you wanted dead. It was with that, that Chinatsu could say she hated her clan.
        <br><br>
        She stared at the pile of viscera for a moment before it began to fade into dust, and she stood on the rooftop
        for even longer until she finally began to walk away.
        <br><br>
        She needed to see Kyoko. She needed to console her.
        <br><br>
        She needed to do something about this…
