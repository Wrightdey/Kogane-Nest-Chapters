                Interlude: Chinatsu Zenin
                <br><br>
                ~The Black Silence~
                <br><br>
            </i>
        </div>

        Chinatsu grit her teeth as she and Argalia took note of the Domains that had been deployed where Obelac was fighting. The buildings around the two were completely destroyed, smoke rising into the sky as her heart beat fast in her chest. “Shit-”
        <br><br>
        Right as the Blue Reverberation was about to strike her, Agito hastily moved to block it. The Shikigami crossed its arms and struggled against the sheer strength pressing against it, but as its arms glowed Argalia recoiled with pain. Agito’s fists glowed with the output of Reverse Cursed Energy which was poisonous to curses like the Vengeful Spirit before them. Chinatsu caught herself as she looked across at her former colleague. 
        <br><br>
        <b>“I said don’t piss me off,”</b> Argalia spat. <b>“I KNOW you have more. <i>Him</i>. Bring him out.”</b>

        Part of a Sorcerer’s many tricks was deception. She only told her brother of her Binding Vow on Mahoraga’s summoning. Divulging that information to Argalia was something she could use to her advantage as well. Sorcerers were con artists, and in the face of a superior opponent Chinatsu needed to embody the slimier aspects that she abandoned when she became a Monster Hunter. For the moment she needed to abandon what she learned as the Black Silence and embrace what she learned as a Zenin. 
        <br><br>
        “I can’t,” she said. “I made a binding vow not to. Not unless I fight a Nightmare superior to me.”
        <br><br>
        Argalia scoffed in response. <b>“Bullshit. There’s no way you’d put that much of a restriction on yourself.”</b>
        <br><br>
        “It makes me even stronger against what I’m supposed to go up against. It’s not a restriction at all.”
        <br><br>
        <b>“Even when I’m here and able to kill you because of it?”</b>
        <br><br>
        “You won’t kill me.”
        <br><br>
        Argalia laughed. It was a long, deep, heavy laugh that got to the point Chinatsu wondered if he was crying instead. Though he had no mouth he still laughed, and though he had no eyes Chinatsu was sure he’d be crying either due to pain or amusement. He eventually stopped and looked at her. <b>“I have no reason to hold back,”</b> he told her. <b>“My wife and son are dead. They died in Tokyo.”</b>
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu felt her blood freeze. “…what…?” Argalia shrugged. 
        <br><br>
        <b>“It’s true. They’re dead. And now I’m here, a Vengeful Spirit, ready and willing to kill every single vampire across my path.”</b>
        <br><br>
        “But why not kill KT!? He’s the one who did that!” she shouted. Her earlier memories of that day began to come back, and her blood got more and more hot. Argalia picked up on this. 
        <br><br>
        <b>“You believe the Sorcerers? I thought you were better than that,”</b> he mocked. Chinatsu clenched her fists. 
        <br><br>
        “I believe because he told me,” she said. “He fucking told me with his own damn mouth that he did!”
        <br><br>
        <b>“And you didn’t kill him? Why? Did your little boyfriend stop you?”</b>
        <br><br>
        When she didn’t answer, Argalia continued on. He stepped closer to Chinatsu as he spoke and she tensed up. <b>“He did, didn't he? Why is that?”</b>
        <br><br>
        “He…” Chinatsu recalled how she had hurt Obelac. How she scared him. Her knees grew weak as she felt herself begin to breathe heavily. She felt her knuckles ache as she recalled beating on KT. She could almost feel the chill of the Tokyo air on her skin. “I…”
        <br><br>
        <b>“Poor Chinatsu,”</b> he mocked. <b>“Did you scare him? Did you let that poor little leech see the darkness you hide?”</b>
        <br><br>
        “Shut up!” Chinatsu screamed. Agito leapt toward Argalia, bolstered by the revealing Binding Vow she had made earlier. It was fast, but not fast enough as the Vengeful Spirit dodged their strike. He swung his hand upward and a crescendo of music filled the air as the ground tore apart. Chinatsu’s eyes widened as Agito lost its right arm in the attack. Blood gushed from the wound as it leapt back to her side. 
        <br><br>
        <b>“You’re too weak to kill him, aren’t you?”</b> He mocked. <b>“The Black Silence is too weak. That’s why you didn’t kill him. Not because your little boy toy stopped you…or perhaps both. Your weakness and your craven need to have that parasite between your legs made you push back your sense of vengeance.”</b>
        <br><br>
        “SHUT THE FUCK UP!” she screamed. Her eyes were red with fury as she leapt forward. Argalia moved to dodge, but couldn’t. He glanced down to see that his legs were slowly sinking into the shadow beneath him. He moved to strike at her, but the Divine Dogs rose up from darkness to bite him and restrain him. In a split second Agito had rejoined the fray and placed its palms on Argalia’s chest. He roared in pain as he thrashed and threatened to break free of these meager constraints. 
        <br><br>
        And yet he wouldn’t have the opportunity to. Chinatsu was in front of him. Her necklace glowed as it only added to the pain he felt from Agito. Her fist was clenched as she glared at him with pure hatred in her eyes. Her arm knocked back as her muscles flexed, and with a powerful blow she slammed her fist dead in his face. 
        <br><br>
        “<b><i>BLACK FLASH!</i></b>”
        <br><br>
        The sparks of black illuminated the night sky as Argalia was sent flying back from her strike. His face cracked from the blow and a blue liquid began to seep from the wound. He was in a building, and with a groan he took himself from the crater. “<b>Did I strike a nerve?</b>” he asked. 
        <br><br>
        His voice was full of venom and amusement as he asked this. He dusted himself off, and Chinatsu raised her fists. 
        <br><br>
        This wasn’t enough. Not nearly enough. Agito stood beside her, and Chinatsu let out a deep breath. Her shadow began to grow in size and expanded outward, engulfing the ground beneath them. Argalia watched and within the blink of an eye he vanished. Agito reacted before Chinatsu did, blocking a strike from the Curse as it was sent back. Chinatsu soon retaliated as she sunk into the darkness itself. Argalia let out a sigh as the blue liquid kept seeping from the crack. Agito was in front of him, its fists still raised. The shadow spread out more and more as it began to engulf that entire area, even engulfing Argalia’s own shadow. “<b>And what are you planning now? Some other meaningless attack? Don’t you know-</b>” 
        <br><br>
        Argalia was cut off by the shadows beneath him forming claws that swung up at him. He leapt in the air, yet that did nothing to dissuade this onslaught. Ten claws sprung up from the shadows, piercing the air as they all swung at Argalia. He swung his arm and the loud, ugly sounds of a violin rang out as these claws were all forcefully dissipated. Argalia wouldn’t be able to land however as right after the claws were vanquished, he was struck by lightning. Agito had begun its attack once more as it clasped its hands together and released a bolt of lightning at him. 
        <br><br>

        <hr>

        <br><br>
        “<b><i>DOMAIN EXPANSION!</i></b>” Obelac shouted. He and Lucius were soon locked into a domain clash, the two boundaries forming and overlapping as contradicting inner domains fought for supremacy. Obelac saw that Lucius’ domain was a lone island basked in a starry night sky. Embedded within the ground were countless shards of bone as tall as Lucius was, which were already considerably taller than Obelac. Obelac figured he must have had a technique alongside Moon Manipulation and whatever critical hit technique he showed earlier. 
        <br><br>
        Obelac knew Lucius would win in the Domain clash. Obelac had barely had his Domain for a month, while Lucius more than likely had his for centuries. The refinement, the experience, all of it surpassed that of Obelac’s. 
        <br><br>
        Lucius grinned as he placed a hand on his hip. He wasn’t moving, which led Obelac to think he was waiting for his domain to win in the clash. Obelac figured he had a handful of seconds before his domain was overwritten. It took the form of a shallow, endless sea with the white full moon at his back, large and oppressive like the gaze of a primordial god. The water soaked into his shoes, but he ignored it. He’d force Lucius to take him seriously, to make him acknowledge that it was Obelac that was the threat there, not that washed up loser across from him. 
        <br><br>
        “So you aren’t as much of a waste as I thought-” 
        <br><br>
        “<i>Maximum Technique-Pandemonium Cetus,</i>” he interrupted. Lucius’ eyes widened as the moon behind Obelac turned black. 
        <br><br>
        In ten seconds, Obelac’s domain would be overwritten. In ten seconds, Lucius would win the clash. Obelac knew this, or had a hunch that it would happen. Yet those ten seconds, Obelac resolved to make it the most painful of Lucius’ life. The dark-moon behind him released a torrent of darkness at the Scion of Fulgur. Lucius would try to deflect it with his own application of the Light-Side, yet as he erected a large pillar of white moonlight, Obelac rushed forward. 
        <br><br>
        Eight seconds until Lucius won the domain Clash, and Obelac was beating him. His fists slammed into his chest and caved in his ribs as he shouted in sheer anger. “You stupid fucking asshole!” he screamed. Lucius grit his teeth as he caught Obelac’s fist, only for his knees to be kicked in and forcing him down. Obelac slammed his foot in his face, coating his shoe with blood and causing teeth to spill onto the ground. 
        <br><br>
        “You know you want to kill him.”

        He tried to ignore the voice inside his head as he stomped down on Lucius' throat. “I’ll fucking kill you, dickhead! I’ll fucking kill you! You hear me!” 
        <br><br>
        Five seconds remained until Lucius would win the domain clash, and with a roar he reached upward and slammed his fist into Obelac's stomach. “YOU VILE WRETCH!” he screamed, spit and blood flying from his mouth. “I’LL SLAUGHTER YOU LIKE A DAMN PIG!”
        <br><br>
        Two seconds remained, and Lucius rose to his feet. He grabbed Obelac by the throat and squeezed. His muscles tensed as he slammed him into the ground. Obelac opened his mouth and did everything he could to scream in his face. Dark-moonlight scorched his face and made him release his grasp from Obelac. Lucius was sent flying into the air, and Obelac hastily rose back to his feet as he caught his breath. 
        <br><br>
        He couldn’t wait. He couldn’t hesitate. He planted both feet onto the ground and summoned his Simple Domain. It was then that the shards of bone began to do something. The bones appeared right in front of him like spears, only to be dissipated by the Simple Domain. 

        <br><br>
        <div id="centered-red">
        “You know you want him dead. I can give you that power. He’s nothing. Nothing but a worthless leech.”
        </div>
        <br><br>
        Lucius landed. His face was burnt as he slowly regenerated. “You damn…brat…” he growled. More and more lances of bone flew forward and slammed into the Simple Domain. Obelac knew he couldn’t fight back. His Cursed Technique was shot. His Simple Domain was on a time limit, and Lucius was slowly regenerating from the wounds he had already left. 
        <br><br>
        A small, miniscule part of him felt that he might die there, but the larger was too consumed with rage to genuinely believe that. He would survive. He would live. He would win-
        <br><br>
        <div id="centered-red">
        “-I can help you kill him. He’s nothing. He’s worthless. He’s no better than Nerd.”
        </div>
        <br><br>
        Obelac paused. That name had brought up a wellspring of rage inside of him. Nerd. <i>Nerd. <b>Nerd</b></i>. 
        <br><br>
        His heart began to swell with rage as his eyes shone with a new fury. The Simple Domain broke, and Obelac was skwered by several lances of bone. His stomach, left leg, right arm, and right shoulder was pierced. He fell down onto a knee as he winced. He looked up at Lucius as he approached him with a smile on his face. He sauntered toward his opponent, his smile turning into a grin. Obelac wanted to kill him, but he couldn’t. He was bleeding and his heart thumped with a rage that did nothing to help him at the moment. 
        <br><br>
        <div id="centered-red">
        “Is this how you want to die, Obelac? I doubt it. Simply say my name, and I can help you. I can assist you. I can help you kill him. Say my name…”
        </div>
        <br><br>
        Something unlocked itself in Obelac’s mind. A memory, or rather something else. A name. A name had made itself known, or perhaps made itself remembered. A simple name, yet one that held immense power. 
        <br><br>
        “Any last words?” Lucius asked with a grin. He kicked Obelac square in the chest and stomped down as he landed on his back. He pulled out a lance from Obelac’s shoulder as he held it poised above him. “May your memory be mocked until the end of-” 
        <br><br>
        “-Carmine,” Obelac muttered. As he said that one word the Domain shattered. The two Kindred were once again in the night. Lucius didn’t notice Obelac, not now. He was too furious at someone else entirely. “…no…” he muttered , genuine shock and confusion in his voice. “No…no no no no no NO! THAT DAMN TRAITOR! CARMINE! DO YOU HEAR ME, YOU VILE WITCH! SHOW YOURSELF!” 

        <br><br>
        <div id="centered-red">
        “I am on your side, Obelac. You need me. You’re not strong enough without me.”
        </div>
        <br><br>
        Obelac grit his teeth as he tried to ignore the voice in his head. He used his free arm to punch Lucius’ leg and caused his bones to shatter. He winced and swung down his bone-spear. Obelac narrowly moved out of the way and was stabbed in his opposite shoulder. He shouted in pain as blood gushed from the wound. Lucius looked down at him with sheer hatred in his eyes. “You…” he snarled. “That damned woman…what has her so possessed with you? You’re not remarkable in the slightest! You’re weak! Pathetic! You’re-” 
        <br><br>
        “My my, having trouble, Lucius?” came another voice. Obelac turned to see three additional men arriving at the battlefield. One of them was nearing seven feet in height and was built of pure muscle. He wore a white compress shirt and a pair of black jeans and boots. The other was a foot shorter and had a lithe frame with pale skin and long black hair. The last was Obelac’s height. He had a tan and had curly red hair. 
        <br><br>
        “Silence, Ahriman,” Lucius spat. The red-head sighed and placed a hand on his hip. “Carmine favors him, it would seem.” 
        <br><br>
        “Your fault for playing with your food, as always,” the tall one, Kharn, said. “Kill him. Be done with it.” 
        <br><br>
        Right as Lucius was about to run Obelac through, an explosion of multicolored light sent him flying back. 
        <br><br>
        “Oh..oh my…” said a voice that Obelac recognized to belong to Hong Lu, one of the Moonlight Lords. “Do you need help, Obelac?”
        <br><br>
        “FUCKING YES!” Obelac shouted. Hong Lu was soon at his side as he helped remove the bones from him. He winced in pain, and Hong Lu soon helped him up. 
        <br><br>
        “Laeticia is already locked in combat,” Hong Lu told him. He was a tall Chinese man with long black hair tied in a single braid and jade green eyes. He wore a red changshang with black flower details and had an ever present smile on his face. “We must deal with these four ourselves. Unless more come to assist us.” 
        <br><br>
        “I doubt that’ll happen…” Obelac panted. “Shit…I need a few to get my Technique back…” 
        <br><br>
        “I cannot hold them back with just me,” Hong Lu said. 
        <br><br>
        “Then I’ll just fucking beat their asses then…” he sighed. 
        <br><br>
        “Are you all done?” asked the man with black hair, Eidolon. Obelac glared at him. 
        <br><br>
        “Why are you trying to kill me?” he asked. “Why are you all? I get why you don’t like me…but don’t you think this is going too fucking far?”
        <br><br>
        Lucius scoffed, but Ahriman hushed him with a wave of the hand. “I have no quarrel with you, child,” he said. “But it is more than just you. Look around you. At this isle and the destruction caused so far due to this battle. This is all we have. The humans have the entire planet and we have simply this island. I know why that is, I know of the time Lionel tried to better our people and that glorified slave Kulani stopped him. I know of the strength of those Higher Up Hounds. I know that we are facing a crisis if we continue simply trying to survive. Our time is now. The Great Progenitor has returned and with her we can once more utilize the power of Excalibur. The Sorcerer’s higher ups will fall before her might. And if it takes faking an attack by humans on Vampire soil to do so, then we will do it.”
        <br><br>
        “Fuck you,” Obelac spat. 
        <br><br>
        “Hong Lu,” Ahriman continued, ignoring Obelac. “You’ve experienced firsthand the evil of humanity and their Sorcerer overlords. You saw your family be slaughtered before your eyes by that slave Kulani. Yet you still smile. You lived through the Taiping Rebellion. You saw the deaths of thirty million of your countrymen. And yet you smile. You continue to fight for a cause and a peace that made you lose everything you love. Why? Why aren’t you mad?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac could hear the rising annoyance in the Kindred’s voice. 
        <br><br>
        “Because being mad is pointless when one doesn’t have the power to change things,” Hong Lu said, still smiling. “I didn’t have power then, when I saw my parents experiment on my siblings. Creating monsters. I didn’t have power when Kulani killed them for actions. I didn’t have power when I was dropped off to my cousin. Only those like Kulani, Brunestud, Lionel, only they have power. Ahriman, we are weak, and can only persist when we acknowledge that.”
        <br><br>
        “You damned fool,” Kharn spat. “You should’ve died with the rest of your fleshbag family.”
        <br><br>
        “Perhaps,” Hong Lu said, shrugging. “I wouldn’t mind either way,”
        <br><br>
        As Obelac looked at the four Vampires, the voice kept speaking. 
        <br><br>
        <div id="centered-red">
        “<i>You will accept me sooner or later. You need me. You’re nothing without me. You need me to do what you’ve always wanted to do. You need me to keep doing the only thing you’re good at doing.</i>”
