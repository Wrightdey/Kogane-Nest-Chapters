                <br><br>
                ~Arbiter of the Isle~
                <br><br>
            </i>
        </div>

        In the moments after she threw Larsen out of her window, Laeticia walked across her office to a portrait of her late husband she had hung on the wall. She gently pulled it from the wall and placed it neatly on the ground beside her. Hidden by the large portrait was a false wall. Laeticia pushed it inward, and hidden by it would be a case that was larger than she was. She pulled it out and placed it on the ground. She opened the case and pulled out her sword. It was longer than she was at six feet in length and was more of a slab of steel than an actual sword. The handle was long, and at the crossguard was a ruby that she had implanted inside. She lifted it as if it weighed no more than a feather and turned to the broken window. She dragged it behind her, the blade carving into her wooden floor as the steel groaned out. 
<br><br>
She looked out the window to see Larsen was still laying down, more out of shock than any form of damage. Laeticia leapt from the hole on the wall and landed in front of him. Larsen slowly rose up, but as he did Laeticia swung her sword down at him. His eyes widened as he dodged out of the way and the blade carved into the land. A small shockwave formed from what would have been a killing blow toward anyone weaker. Larsen rose to his feet, but was met with a foot in his stomach as Laeticia kicked him. He flew into the air and the woman leapt after him in haste. 
<br><br>
Laetica flew upward, sword in hand as she caught up to the off-guard traitorous lord. The ground exploded beneath her due to the sheer force of her launching upward, and as she held her blade aloft she swung it in a horizontal arc. Larsen had quickly blocked the blow with his arms, his reward for blocking being the loss of his limbs. He cried out in pain as he began falling back to the ground. Laetia’s eyes were red with fury as she fell with him. Her cape flowed as she poised her blade to run him through. Larsen grit his teeth as he released a blast of dark-moonlight point blank at the one he considered a sister. Laeticia roared in pain as she was blown back and careened through the air. 
<br><br>
She crashed into the ground and formed a crater from the sheer force. She didn’t have the time to rise in a dignified manner, instead she leapt upward as she held onto her sword. Larsen landed beside her, his eyes narrowed. Laeticia scoffed. “Your heart isn’t in this, wretch?” she asked as she stood tall, sticking up her nose at him. 
<br><br>
“I do not wish to hurt-” 
<br><br>
“Traitors don’t get to choose,” she said. “Either you stand down or I’ll make you.” 
<br><br>
“Even if it means killing me?” 
<br><br>
She paused at that and looked him in the eyes. “Yes. If whatever illness has clouded your mind to such degree has you committing acts against the Great Progenitor-” 
<br><br>
“This is to her benefit-” 
<br><br>
“Muderering her son in cold blood is to her benefit? What makes you think Lionel or Demon wouldn’t slaughter you for such an act? Let alone the Great Progenitor herself. Tell me, Larsen, what poison has Lucius sold you?” 
<br><br>
“He opened my eyes!” 
<br><br>
“Oh, he opened your eyes, did he? No. No, he deluded you. He poisoned your mind, you damned fool!” 
<br><br>
Laeticia lunged at him. Larsen was caught off guard as her blade swept through the air and bit into his stomach. Flesh was carved through as steel carved through the Second Kindred. Blood flew into the air as Larsen was sent flying. He crashed into the ground, his life essence spilling and mixing into the dirt. The one he called sister didn’t stop there, and ran after the traitorous scum. Larsen’s wound was healing, yet as he rose up Laeticia was already upon him. She held the blade with both hands, raised high above her head in a killing blow. 
<br><br>
Larsen was disturbed. Truly and utterly disturbed. He thought Laeticia would be more reserved. He thought she’d hear him out, or at least wouldn’t be as blood-thirsty as she was. But he was wrong. She was trying to kill him, and despite that he couldn’t bring himself to retaliate in full.
<br><br>
When Laeticia swung down he tried to dodge, yet the blow would not come. Laeticia Jaynelle’s eyes widened as she was sent flying away. It was not a physical blow that did this but a sudden yet powerful pulse of Cursed Energy. The Arbiter’s sword left her hand as she was sent crashing into the side of a building, one belonging to one of her sired Kindred. She was dazed, confused, and as the residents inside rushed to help their lord, Laeticia brushed them aside. She rose to her feet and saw that alongside Larsen, three hooded figures had joined him. Their Cursed Energy signatures stood out like a sore thumb. 
<br><br>
She had sensed a signature similar to it flair up briefly before, one that she recongized to be the Black Silence. These hooded figures were human. Human rebels. Human scum that dared harm a Moonlight Lord on Vampire soil. 
<br><br>
“Lady Laeticia…” muttered a young man named Edric, a twenty three year-old Nineteenth Kindred. “What’s going on? We all heard these noises but-” 
<br><br>
“Leave me,” she ordered. “Stay inside, do not go out. There are traitors here.” 
<br><br>
“But-”
<br><br>
“That is an order,” she said through gritted teeth. Edric glanced at his sisters and brothers, and nodded. 
<br><br>
“Yes…my lady…” he said as he led his family away from their grandsire. In that moment, Laeticia wondered if that was how the Great Progenitor felt toward their people as a whole. In her fury she forgot that those who shared her blood were not as strong as her. She was strong, stronger than them, and she could not risk them getting harmed. She’d much rather die herself than let innocents die in her name.
<br><br>
She swore she’d never let that happen again. 
<br><br>
Twelve orbs of dark-moonlight appeared behind Laetica, and faster than lightning she leapt forward. Dust and debris kicked up from the speed of her movements as she shot them out toward the human scum. Blasts shot forward, near invisible in the darkness of the night. The Sorcerers, though skilled, were nothing compared to the might of their natural superiors. Two were cut through, four blasts carving through their heart, stomach, brain, and throat. An instant kill. The final Sorcerer, the one that had sent her flying, was able to avoid her attack. She saw their movements, noting the unnatural swiftness with which they did so. They sensed it and moved as if they were a puppet on a string. 
<br><br>
Larsen ran toward her. His fists were held up, and as Laeticia released a blast at him he blocked it with his application of light-moonlight. He got closer and threw a punch, the blow blasting through the air and slamming into Laeticia’s stomach. She pushed through the pain and bursted internal organs as she grabbed onto his hand. She dug her nails into the flesh, and as Larsen tried to pull back she wouldn’t let him. She poured Cursed Energy into his arm, and his eyes widened as she realized what she was doing. 
<br><br>
“LAE-” was all he said before his arm was blown apart. He growled in a mixture of anger and pain, even as his stump began the process of healing. Laeticia’s organs began to heal as well, and she noted the Sorcerer closing in on her. Larsen must’ve noted it as well, as he threw another punch at Laeticia. She sidestepped the blow and leapt forward to the human. She noted their movements quickened as she approached, but they were still too slow for her. She took a note from Obelac’s book, using dark-moonlight to rocket herself through the air. 
<br><br>
She sensed the human’s fear as he was upon him. She relished in it, basked in it. She slammed into them as they crashed into the ground, and with no warning or fanfare she wretched her fist up and hammered it down. Their skull splattered into chunks of viscera. Her hand was slick with blood, and she licked it clean as she rose up. 
<br><br>
“Disgusting. Marjuana and tobacco have the same taste…” she muttered. 
<br><br>
“How brutal,” Larsen commented. She turned to him. 
<br><br>
“You talk instead of fighting me?”
<br><br>
“I can talk and fight. I want you to see my reasoning, Laeticia. We fought together for so so long, why can’t you see my point?” 
<br><br>
“Because you always spoke with logic and sense then, not now. Now you speak of delusion and barbarism.” 
<br><br>
Larsen groaned in annoyance. “You absolute fool.” 
<br><br>
“You moronic heathen,” she spat. “Don't you dare call me that.” 
<br><br>
“You are not hearing sense! We are doing this-”
<br><br>
“You are conspiring with humans of all abominable beings! Those…wretched, foolish creatures…” 
<br><br>
He paused at that, genuinely upset. “...it was not my choice to associate with them,” he admitted. “I’d…if it was my choice, I never would-”
<br><br>
“-Larsen, Larsen, is your mind wavering?” said a new voice. The two turned to it and saw a hulking man walking toward them. Their skin was pale, not similar to the moon like older vampires, but a sickly, malnourished paleness. Their skin was gaunt, their eyes red, and they had white hair that covered their ears. They wore a simple dark green t-shirt with black cargo pants and black boots. They were Typhon, a Third Kindred descended from the line of Morrigan. “That is no good, no good at all.” 
<br><br>
“You…” she spat. “You’ve been affected by this madness as well?”
<br><br>
“It’s not madness, it’s reason,” he said. “The Great Progenitor is too soft. Lionel is too soft. Even you are too soft. You talk of consequences to actions and upholding the law, yet Obelac is given far more leeway than anyone would be.” 
<br><br>
“Again with him? What is it about him that makes you all obsessed with a mere child?” 
<br><br>
Typhon came closer, and Laeticia tensed up. “Oh, not him in particular, just patterns that concern a large number of us. His rebellious streak, his hatred of us, who he associates with, and the fact that someone who despises us is given power over us. Tell me, Laeticia, if it had been I who assaulted the Great Progenitor and dared to land a Black Flash on her, would you let me live?” 
<br><br>
She paused at that and grit her teeth. They both knew the answer. Typhon grinned. “So, we have this child who committed an act that would have anyone else executed, and instead of any real consequence he is made to train under you. A decent punishment, if what he did wasn’t the height of Fillial Impiety. But he has not changed. He still hates us. He is still the same rageful child he was as he joined us three years ago. Yes, we will be executed when we kill him, but in killing him we will be free of the tumor he represents, of us compromising our ideals.” 
<br><br>
“You fool…” she said. 
<br><br>
“You are a broken record, Laeticia,” Typhon said. “Do you have affection for the child?” 
<br><br>
“Absolutely not.” 
<br><br>
“Then why do you defend him so fiercely?”
<br><br>
“He is a child!” she spat. “How is such a simple concept passing over your heads? He-” 
<br><br>
Typhon raised his hand to interrupt. “-no,” he said. “No, it’s not that simple. “No…I think I know the reason why. He reminds you of someone, doesn’t he? Someone you lost long ago.” 
<br><br>

She didn’t even process the next few seconds. It wasn’t until she felt a hotness in her left arm that she realized she lunged at Typhon and sunk her fist in his stomach. His blood coated her arm and stained her dress-shirt as she stared into his eyes. Red on Red. Typhon smiled. 
<br><br>
“So, that's it then,” he said as blood spilled from his mouth. “He reminds you of poor little-” 
<br><br>
Laeticia moved for a killing blow, but her right arm was blown off her body by Larsen as he snapped himself from his stupor. He rushed toward Laetica, and the woman grit her teeth as she pulled her arm from Typhon’s stomach. The Third Kindred began to regenerate but he still pushed onward despite the pain. He decked Laeticia in the face, and as she was reeling from the sudden blow she felt a sharp pain in her arm still soaked with the traitor’s blood. A mere glance saw that his blood was melting through her skin. 
<br><br>
Larsen was getting closer and Typhon wrapped his arms around her to hold her in place. Her right arm was regenerating and her left arm was being melted down to the bone. She struggled, and in that moment her anger made her disregard any sense of propriety as she stomped down hard on Typhon’s foot. His grip lessened as she heard bones crack, and she used her melting arm to break free and throw him into Larsen’s way. The traitor caught his cohort and Laetia was finally able to focus on fully regenerating now. She was dipping into her Cursed Energy reserves to combine the healing effects of Reverse Cursed Technique with her own innate healing capabilities to perform instantaneous regeneration. Her left arm was fully restored and her right was growing back, though that didn’t get rid of Typhon’s blood. She hastily tore it off and regenerated it fully. 
<br><br>
As Laeticia looked onward to her enemies, two spikes of Cursed Energy swelled up. The three combatants recognized it to be the deployment of Domains. 
<br><br>
Typhon smiled. “The child is dead, it would seem.”
