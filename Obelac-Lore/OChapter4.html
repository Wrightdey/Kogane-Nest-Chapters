        <h3>
            Obelac had stared at the dinner invitation for around five minutes before he picked it up. It was addressed
            by Jussom Nerd, the one Sorcerer he had hated more than anyone else. Although for rather petty, yet
            justified reasons, that resentment still existed within him. He figured it’d cause more harm than good in
            refusing his invitation, no matter what he wished he did.<br><br>

            The restaurant itself was a rather high end one with a dress code that he simply had no ways of meeting. A
            part of him figured it was another way for Nerd to flex his wealth and status. He supposed he could scrounge
            up an acceptable suit, but that would take too long to search for the right place to get a suit
            from.<br><br>

            Unless he were to call upon a person he’d rather not consult. He pushed the idea to the back of his head,
            instead deciding to just find a place out in the city.<br><br>

            He nodded, agreeing with that choice, prepared to use most of the earnings he didn’t put into his savings.
        </h3>

        <br>
        <hr><br>

        <h3>The restaurant in question was luxurious. Its name was Dorisa, a restaurant where only the wealthiest and
            most influential individuals were able to reserve a seat. The fact that Nerd was able to reserve a place at
            an establishment as this on such short notice, Obelac didn’t want to comment on it to his face. The walls
            were a white marble and were decorated with golden trimming. Marble pillars held up the ceiling, and the
            wait-staff were all well dressed.</h3>

        <h3>He still wore his glasses, and his gait betrayed his common origins as he entered. Those who looked upon him
            were able to tell that he ordinarily shouldn’t even be in a mile wide radius of this place, let alone enter
            it. The small dread he felt upon trying to explain just who he was dining with was eradicated once he saw
            the Sorcerer himself before him.</h3>

        <h3>
            “Ah, there you are,” Nerd smirked. “I see you bought something nice for yourself. Well, nice for people
            other than me, that is.”<br><br>

            “Why thank you,” he said dryly. Nerd’s smile never faded.<br><br>

            “Don’t take it personally, I don’t want to insult you. Or at least I don’t intend on it. If you take offense
            to what I do, then perhaps you need to understand why it makes you feel that way?”<br><br>


            “Just tell me why you invited me here.”<br><br>

            “I wanted to give you a proposition,” he said. “Isn’t that how most discussions are held? Over
            dinner?”<br><br>

            “You know it won’t sustain me.”<br><br>

            “But you’ll still savor its taste, would you not?”<br><br>

            “I would.”<br><br>

            “Then there’s nothing to take issue with,” he said, letting the topic drop. Obelac rolled his eyes as he
            followed Nerd to a table. The two Special Grades sat down, whereupon Jussom Nerd looked across at his
            contemporary. <br><br>

            “Now, I won’t take too much of your assumedly precious time,” he said. “I know you have your own things to
            do,” Nerd began. “So, I’ll be frank. I want you to work with me.”<br><br>


            Obelac stared at Nerd for a brief eternity before replying.<br><br>

            “Excuse me?”<br><br>

            “Your ears are fully functioning,” he said, sighing. “There is no need for me to repeat myself,
            Obelac.”<br><br>

            “Why would I work for you?”<br><br>

            “Why not,” Nerd responded. “It’s not like you’re living for anything. All you do as a Sorcerer is kill
            Curses-”<br><br>

            “-Because it’s our fucking job.” Obelac spat, his voice stern and barely holding back anger. “It’s not about
            fighting or protecting the higher ups or anything else. It's about killing Curses!”<br><br>

            “You could try telling Dane that,” Nerd supposed. “Have you met with him recently? Given that little slip, I
            presume you have.”<br><br>

            Obelac caught himself for a moment. “...he trains me. Swordplay.”<br><br>

            “Ah. Makes sense. Of course someone would seek the ‘Special Grade Swordsman’ for training. Thoug
            Dane…”<br><br>

            Nerd shook his head, brushing the unfinished sentence aside. “Your perception of what a Sorcerer does is
            frankly disgusting,” Nerd said. “As is Dane’s, KT’s, and most others who bare our rank. Our status is not
            fighting others, nor killing curses or protecting the weak, it’s doing what we want.”<br><br>

            Obelac glared at him. “And you want me as what, then? A pawn?”<br><br>

            “I’d more consider you a Rook,” he mused. “But no. I want to see your power fulfilled. You know you’re not
            the only living Kindred of Brunestud herself.”<br><br>

            “I obviously know.”<br><br>

            “And you know how strong he is. Lionel Harlow, the First Kindred who has been in action since the Golden
            Age. Possessing both Moon Manipulation and Cursed Spirit Manipulation, he is at a level beyond most Special
            Grades. He could even be considered your br-”<br><br>

            “He’s not,” Obelac interrupted. Nerd just smiled, ignoring his growing irritations. “So what then, you want
            me to grow stronger? For what? What do you get out of it?”<br><br>

            “A passing curiosity,” he said. A waiter would come with food, despite them not having ordered anything.
            Right as Obelac was about to comment, Nerd silenced him with a motion. Alongside food, the waiter gave them
            a bottle of wine and two glasses, which they then poured into them. The waiter bowed, then left. Obelac had
            a pasta dish, one that's auroma made his mouth water. Nerd had a meat dish, a steak with potatoes and
            asparagus.<br><br>

            Nerd would start cutting his steak, glancing across at Obelac. “Aren’t you going to eat,” he asked him.
            “Don’t let the food get cold. People worked hard for that.”<br><br>

            “As if you care,” Obelac taunted. Nerd chuckled, reaching over to his wine glass and taking a small
            sip.<br><br>

            “No, I do care,” he said. “Everyone has a purpose, or at least are supposed to. In the ages past, where the
            population wasn’t as large, everyone had a function. The kings led, advisors advised, bakers baked, cooks
            cooked, fishers fished. Everyone had a role, and everyone was protected. But now…there is no purpose for
            most others. There are millions of Sorcerers, not even counting those in service to the Church, the Monster
            Hunters, and other irrelevant organizations. Do all of those Sorcerers have a purpose? A genuine role that
            they and they alone can fulfill? One that you or I can’t surpass them in? No. They don’t. A cook cannot
            become a warrior, a warrior cannot become a cook. A king can’t become a fisherman nor a fisherman a king.
            Everyone has something they’re good at, but this world is one where their skills are wasted away.”<br><br>

            He gestured to the restaurant, filled with the higher ups of mundane society. “Everyone here is a ruler, who
            employs those who they trust or have leverage over as their subordinates. Those subordinates have lesser
            subordinates, who in turn have their own subordinates, rinse and repeat until it trickles down to where the
            Ruler has no true control. Only in theory.”<br><br>

            “And your point,” Obelac asked, his food untouched. Nerd took a bite of his stake, chewed, savored, then
            swallowed.<br><br>

            “My point, Obelac, is that we are not the lesser, roleless Sorcerers. You are a warrior. Pretending to be
            anything else is not only unsightly, it is an insult to yourself.”<br><br>

            “If I’m a warrior, then are you a ruler?”<br><br>

            Nerd looked at him for a moment, ate another piece of his steak, then pondered. “Good question,” he said
            simply. “Anyway, I say all this because I offer you a proposition. You work with me, and I’ll show you just
            how powerful people like us are, and what we deserve in this world filled with mediocrity.”<br><br>

            “And if I refuse?”<br><br>

            He shrugged. “I always get what I want in the end,” he said as he continued eating. Obelac stared at his
            food, before then getting up from the table.<br><br>

            “I’ll prepare a to-go box for you,” Nerd said. “You can expect it at your home shortly.”<br><br>

            Obelac could feel his gaze as he walked off, his head pounding.
