        <h3>
            “Again!”<br><br>

            The Special Grade Sorcerer, Dane Simmonson, leapt toward his training partner. Dane, and many other Sorcerers for that matter, were adept at the usage of swords, specifically Katanas. Obelac figured that it was due to the Japanese origins of Jujutsu. He himself preferred European swords like broadswords.<br><br>

            Of course, as he hastily parried Dane’s blows, using his superior physical skills to keep up with Dane’s obviously superior swordsmanship, this meant he was at varying different disadvantages. The primary one being that Obelac was unable to use the <i>Heavenly Strike</i> technique.<br><br>

            “Don’t keep defending, Obelac! Attack! Show me why you’re stronger!”<br><br>

            The Vampire grit his teeth as he kept deflecting Dane’s blows. He had no problem keeping up with him, nor was he overwhelmed, but Obelac simply couldn’t find an opening on Dane that he wouldn’t immediately shut down. Dane was lighting fast with the blade, only eclipsed by Liv among Special Grade Sorcerers.<br><br> 

            The backlash from their blows caused parts of the ground to shatter. With each block of Dane’s blade, the force behind Obelac’s strikes caused him to readjust, and forced Dane to reinforce himself to the utmost to keep up.<br><br>

            Dane’s ferocity increased, sparks flew from the two swords as he pushed Obelac back. “There’s hesitation in your blade. Why? Too scared you’ll hurt me? How condescending!”<br><br>

            Dane kicked at Obelac’s legs, who-not expecting it, was knocked down onto his back. Dane immediately went for the deciding blow. In the split second he thrusted his blade downward with the intent to pierce Obelac’s heart, the vampire had batted his blade aside with his arm, the force causing it to fly out of his hand. A split second later Obelac tried to retaliate with his own blade. He grit his teeth, swinging in an arc that threatened to cut Dane clean in half. The force of his blow caused the ground in his path to be blown away by the sheer strength put behind it. Yet the swordsman was unaffected. The moment his blade would’ve made contact with skin, Dane vanished. In his place, and what Obelac ended up hitting, was the scabbard of his sword. He hastily got up, only to see Dane’s blade mere inches away from his face. He grit his teeth, reaching up with his free hand to grab it and stop it in place. His hand bled as he held the katana still, and using it as leverage he’d try to move it out of the way. Yet as he did, the blade would be replaced by the scabbard, and Obelac felt a sudden warmth in his stomach. Looking down, he saw Dane’s blade piercing him.<br><br>

            “Ah,” he said simply, sighing. Despite the fact that this would’ve disemboweled any other, or at least massively harm them, he barely felt anything. That wasn’t to say Dane was weak, but rather Obelac was truly inhuman.<br><br>

            Dane pulled his blade from Obelac’s stomach, and his wound would immediately start to heal itself, even without him using Reverse Curse Technique.<br><br>

            “You’re sloppy,” Dane told him. “You’re too scared of your strength. You’re holding back.”<br><br>

            “I don’t wanna hurt you?”<br><br>

            “You’re saying I’m weak?”<br><br>

            Obelac’s eyes widened at that, only for Dane to laugh. “Nah, I’m messing with you. But Obelac, your fear to use your full strength’ll only get you killed.”<br><br> 

            “I’m not like that with people,” he said. “I kill curses with the seriousness it deserves.”<br><br>

            “And if you came across a person?”<br><br> 

            Obelac adjusted his glasses, his artificial brown eyes avoiding Dane. “I don’t know.”<br><br>

            Dane sighed, placing a hand on Obelac’s shoulder. “You’ll need to find out, eventually,” he said. Obelac sighed, and the two special Grades would hear someone approach. Turning, they’d see fellow Sorcerer Demon Akistuha.<br><br>

            Demon was known to be a Vampire, unlike Obelac who hid this fact. To others, Demon was a reserved, pessimistic Sorcerer who acted as the liaison between Jujutsu Society and the Moonlight Lords. But to Obelac, she was more. She was the most terrifying person he had met, and someone who resembled an older sister. With a flair for the dramatic, she often had over exaggerated mannerisms, which was evident as she gleefully stepped toward the two.<br><br>

            “I see you two are messing everything up,” she said teasingly. Dane simply chuckled, while Obelac looked off to the side. The tone she spoke in, one of familiarity and happiness, reminded him of when she pushed him to the point of exhaustion trying to get him to learn Simple Domain.<br><br>

            “Sorry…” Obelac mumbled. Demon looked down at the higher Kindred, one who she was, by the laws of their society, supposed to obey, and laughed.<br><br>

            “Don’t apologize to me. Apologize to Tesoro. This is his training ground, though he rarely uses it.”<br><br>

            “What does he even do…” Obelac mumbled.<br><br>


            “I’ll tell him you said that,” Demon said, to which Obelac’s eyes widened in shock. He looked at her, yet when he saw she was straining to hold back laughter he rolled his eyes and groaned.<br><br> 

            “Yeah, yeah, whatever…” he sighed. “Why are you here?”<br><br>

            “Your girlfriend was looking for you.”<br><br>

            “She’s not my girlfriend.”<br><br>

            “But you still knew who I meant,” she teased.<br><br>

            “...shut up,” Obelac said, sheathing his sword as he walked off, leaving Dane and Demon together.<br><br>

            Tesoro’s compound was rather simple. The Sorcerer did things on his own terms, and as such rarely used the facilities Jujutsu Headquarters gave him. Obelac walked through the garden that was for whatever reason still well kept. He came to the front door and passed through, seeing Chinatsu waiting for him. She was dressed in a red sweater, black jeans, and a pair of red sneakers. Her hair was let down from its usual bun, and fell down to the top of her back.<br><br>

            “Hey,” he said, smiling. Chinatsu smiled as well.<br><br>

            “Hey. How was everything?”<br><br>

            “Good,” he said. “Nothing major happened. Just did another assignment.”<br><br> 

            “Really? What was that?”<br><br> 

            She shrugged. “Had to kill some sort of…dream monster? Wasn’t quite a curse, but it was close enough to it. But enough about that, you ready?”<br><br>

            Obelac wiped the sweat from his brow and nodded. Chinatsu’s smile never faded. “Then how about we get a special ride there?”<br><br> 

            “Special ride?”<br><br>

            Chinatsu smiled, and made a bird shape with her hands. A split second later, a giant bird the size of a small home appeared. Nue, one of the Ten Shadows. Chinatsu helped Obelac on, and they’d soon ascend into the sky.<br><br>

            Demon and Dane watched the scene from a ways off.<br><br>

            “They’re fucking,” Demon said.<br><br>

            Dane nodded. “They’re fucking.”<br><br>
