        <h1>Chapter Twenty One: Hills Are Painted</h1><br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
        “<b>What happened to me, you ask?</b> Argalia repeated to Chinatsu. “<b>It’s simple. I was turned into a
            Vengeful
            Spirit.</b>”
        <br><br>
        “What…?” she asked in confusion. The being before them placed a hand on his hip.
        <br><br>
        “<b>I take it you know what happened in Tokyo?</b>” he asked. Obelac noticed that Chinatsu tensed up at that. He
        saw
        her fists clench and her breathing increase.
        <br><br>
        “Who the hell hasn’t?” she said. “I went there. Of course I know what the fuck happened.”
        <br><br>
        Argalia let out a small chuckle. “<b>I lost something of mine there,” he said. “And made a decision that I am
            immensely regretting. However…with that mistake I have been given this opportunity.</b>”
        <br><br>
        Obelac noted that he sounded somber, even if his words sounded like they were tinged with vague amusement. “<b>I
            know I will die. But I’ll make sure I take as many of these damned leeches with me. And if you don’t want me
            to,
            then kill me. You’re the only one here possessed with the unique skills to do so.</b>”
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu glared at him. “You think I’d use him against someone like you?”
        <br><br>
        “<b>Or you and your bastard of a lover will die.</b>”
        <br><br>
        Right as Chinatsu was about to respond, Lucius interjected. “Now, don’t get hasty. Obelac is mine to kill.
        Carmine can go weep in anger for all I care, the child is mine.”
        <br><br>
        “Oh fuck off,” Obelac snapped. “You didn’t have the balls to fight me when you came to my town all that time
        ago. In fact, you stood still like a bitch while I punched you in the teeth. You’re just a grown ass man whining
        and beefing with me over shit I can’t even control.”
        <br><br>
        He saw Lucius’ eye twitch as he stepped forward. “Careful, boy,” he snarled. “I showed myself there as a
        kindness to you. You continue to associate yourself with these…insects. You lay with them, eat with them, drink
        with them, associate with them. You are a Vampire in blood only. In heritage and practice you are nothing but a
        weak, pathetic human-“
        <br><br>
        A sound wave cut the ground in front of Lucius as Argalia turned to him. “<b>Battle your own quarry, worm.
            Before I
            get the urge to add you to my list of kills.</b>”
        <br><br>
        Lucius scoffed. “Vile wretch. How dare you-“
        <br><br>
        “<b>Get to hunting, or else I’ll do to you what I did to your beloved Ferrus.</b>”
        <br><br>
        Lucius glared at Argalia, and right as Obelac felt a fight would break out before the two, Lucius turned from
        him. “Hurry up and kill the Silence child,” he said simply.
        <br><br>
        “Hold on-“ Obelac began. He found himself about to step toward them, but as soon as his foot touched the ground
        a puff of wind would send him back a little. He turned to see that Argalia and Chinatsu were gone, leaving just
        him with Lucius. He hastily turned around to try and find her, but that only earned him a strike from Lucius
        that he narrowly dodged.
        <br><br>
        Obelac didn’t know how strong Lucius was before, but the man before him now was easily nearing his level. He
        knew that they both shared the Moon Manipulation Technique. The lapse, the Light Side, consisted of the ability
        of reflection. The reversal, the Dark Side, manifested as a malleable darkness that could be manipulated to the
        user’s whim. The combination technique, the Hollow, manifested miniature moons.
        <br><br>
        Obelac and Lucius had access to at least the same Cursed Technique. The only difference would be their
        applications of it.
        <br><br>
        The battle began with him slugging the pompous ass right in the face. Lucius was sent flying into the sky as he
        followed after. The Second Kindred didn’t even have the time to react before Obelac grabbed his ankle and
        slammed him down into the ground with a thunderous crack. The ground splintered from the impact as dirt and
        debris was kicked up from the attack. Right as Obelac moved to pummel him into the ground, Lucius would quickly
        rise to his feet quicker than the First expected. His eyes were mad, full of rage and hatred as he lunged
        forward.
        <br><br>
        “You damn brat!” he roared. Lucius thrusted his rapier toward Obelac, and from the tip released a blast of
        dark-moonlight. Obelac hastily crossed his arms as he took the attack head on and was pushed back. He could feel
        the flesh of his arms tearing as he grit his teeth, and when the blast ended he rushed toward his opponent.
        Lucius released another blast, yet this time Obelac leapt into the air to avoid it. He was above Lucius then,
        and right as his opponent looked up at him Obelac let out a scream. The ground shook as he released a blast of
        dark-moonlight right at Lucius, bathing him in it. He roared out in agony, and Obelac could smell the scent of
        cooking meat.
        <br><br>
        Obelac landed, but right as he did Lucius lunged from the smoke left by the First Kindred’s attack. Rapier in
        hand, he thrusted at Obelac and was narrowly avoided by him. He was strong, nearly stronger than him for
        whatever reason, and that made all the difference. Right as Obelac avoided one strike another followed up and
        struck him in the arm. The strike was strong, much stronger than Obelac expected as it blew his arm right off.
        He winced in pain, but just as soon his arm would start to regrow he was already set to retaliate. Obelac sensed
        a spike of Cursed Energy indicative of the activation of a Cursed Technique. He assumed that this one was one
        that forcefully created a weakness, or one that negated durability.
        <br><br>
        Lucius thrusted again, and Obelac used his free hand to catch his rapier right as it was set to pierce his
        chest. He pushed it aside and landed a strong kick to Lucius’ side. He grit his teeth yet continued with his
        attack. Lightning fast jabs were either parried or dodged with the same speed. Obelac couldn’t afford a singular
        blow to land, and both of them knew this. It was then that Obelac realized this was his first fight to the death
        against another person. Yes, to the death. He was resolute to kill Lucius.
        <br><br>

        <div id="header">
            <i>
                Interlude: Chinatsu Zenin
                <br><br>
                ~The Black Silence~
                <br><br>
            </i>
        </div>

        Argalia had grabbed Chinatu by the throat as he threw her a ways away from Obelac and Lucius. The Blue
        Reverberation stood tall as he looked at the Black Silence, the two former comrades staring at eachother.
        Chinatsu was wholly unprepared for combat against a being on Argalia’s level. Even when he was a human he was
        stronger than him, but as he was now she only had one option to survive. This Cursed Spirit’s strength reminded
        Chinatsu of Gebura, the leader of the Monster Hunters who possessed a Heavenly Restriction. She knew that Gebura
        and Liv were somewhat relative in strength, but Argalia couldn’t be on that level of sheer power. She could
        sense that his Cursed Energy surpassed all those in the Monster Hunters, her own, and even Obelac’s. The only
        person who she could think of who had more was Hello.
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu had no armor and no weapons, only the clothes on her back, her Magatama necklace, and the few hours of
        sleep she had before that damned letter reached their home. She was out of it. She was full of rage, but she
        still couldn’t bring herself to hate Argalia fully. He annoyed her, he frustrated her, but she couldn’t find it
        within her to hate him. That was the binding vow she made with herself, that in order to increase its strength
        she wouldn’t be able to summon Mahoraga if she didn’t have hatred in her heart toward her opponent.
        <br><br>
        “<b>Why are you staring at me?</b>” Argalia asked her. “<b>Do you feel pity for me?</b>”
        <br><br>
        “Just what the hell happened?” she asked him. The Vengeful Spirit didn’t answer her question.
        <br><br>
        “<b>I’ll tell you if you can hold your own against me,</b>” he told her. He readied his scythe, and Chinatsu
        narrowed
        her eyes. She hastily assumed a formation, and quicker than she could react she dodged an attack that she could
        not see coming. Argalia’s scythe met air as he swung at her. She had used Simple Domain, specifically a
        reprogrammed version she learned from Hello. It allowed the user to react automatically to oncoming attacks at
        the cost of not attacking themselves.
        <br><br>
        The instant Argalia saw that his attack missed, Chinatsu would be forced to leap into the air as the Blue
        Reverberation retaliated. A soundwave cut through the air and caused a massive crater to form where the Zenin
        once was. Chinatsu landed, and with a hand sign summoned the Divine Dogs. The beasts rose from shadow, towering
        over both their summoner and their opponent as they were closer in size to an elephant than mere wolves. The
        beasts had a shadow-like immaterial appearance despite their immense size. Chinatsu had summoned them without a
        physical body to prevent their destruction. She knew Argalia as he was currently was strong enough to destroy
        most of her summons.
        <br><br>
        Argalia and the Divine Dogs leapt at eachother. With little effort the Blue Reverberation cleaved them in two,
        yet they did not vanish. The severed halves would start to reach back to their lower parts, and as they did
        Chinatsu rushed forward. The Magatama necklace she had possessed the ability to protect her from Curses, which
        manifested in the form of releasing Positive Energy whenever one struck her. She reinforced her arms with Cursed
        Energy as she threw a fist at Argalia. Though he dodged it, she used that split second to have the newly
        reconstituted Divine Dogs to slash at him. He was a millisecond too slow to avoid it, the dogs catching him in
        the leg as he tried to leap backward. Argalia didn’t make a noise as purple blood flowed from his wound, and
        within seconds it had healed.
        <br><br>
        Argalia landed. “<b>I know you have more than this,</b>” he told Chinatsu. “<b>Don’t hold back. Not against me.
            I’ll
            slaughter you like a pig if you piss me off like that.</b>”
        <br><br>
        She narrowed her eyes. “...alright, then,” Chinatsu said, mainly to herself. Three shadows rose up beside her,
        fusing into a singular beast. Nue, Round Deer, and Tiger Funeral all joined to create a Shadow that Chinatsu had
        used a handful of times before. Merged Beast Agito, a towering Shikigami now stood beside Chinatsu. Argalia
        looked up at it and flicked his scythe.
        <br><br>
        Right as Chinatsu was about to attack, and explosion caught her attention. She looked off to the side to see
        Obelac throwing someone through a building, and as she glanced back Argalia was right in front of her. His
        strike was blocked by Agito, the Shikigami struggling beneath his strength.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <hr><br>

        The two Kindred kept attacking and dodging. Lucius was poking and proding at Obelac’s defenses, while Obelac was
        testing the extent of Lucius’ abilities. He could tell that Lucius was stronger than Laeticia. Lucius was
        already stronger than Obelac was before he drank blood, but now his strength had increased. Lucius swiped his
        blade in an arc and Obelac ducked to avoid it, yet as he did this Lucius would kick him right in the face. His
        head didn’t explode, but he felt his jaw crack and one of his eyes pop. The same technique used before had
        landed, and it seemed it wasn’t tied to Lucius’ blade.
        <br><br>
        Obelac hastily leapt back, but Lucius wouldn’t lose this opportunity. As Obelac was in the air Lucius would
        chase after him. He hurled his blade toward him, yet Obelac was prepared. He outstretched his hand and from it
        formed a small makeshift shield made of pure moonlight. Lucius’ strike landed and the force of his own attack
        was reverted back onto him. An explosion rang out as he was sent flying, and Obelac landed. As his face healed
        he’d crack his neck.
        <br><br>
        “Right…that’s how it is…” he said. He watched as his opponent rose to his feet. He couldn’t afford to hold
        anything back. He needed to deal with Lucius, then help Chinatsu.
        <br><br>
        He assumed a formation. Brunestud had trained Obelac in a handful of techniques she learned, one of them being
        the Ancient Greek fighting style of Pankration.
        <br><br>
        Lucius was on him now. Enhancing his movements with dark moonlight, he rocketed forward. Obelac could see him
        still. And right as he was in front of him, Obelac-
        <br><br>
        <p style="color: maroon;"><b><i>"Listen to me."</b></i></p>
        <br><br>
        -Was struck. He should’ve blocked it. He would’ve blocked it. He was going to block it. He knew he was going to,
        yet he didn’t. He couldn’t. Something…something made him not do it. A voice in his head. A damned voice
        distracted him, blinded him and took over all of his senses for the briefest of moments. His chest began to heal
        itself as he rose to his feet. Lucius grinned.
        <br><br>
        “Is this the Great Progenitor’s favored child?” he taunted. “This weakness?”
        <br><br>
        “Eat shit you bitch ass loser,” Obelac scoffed. “You couldn’t take me on normally, so you get juiced up by a
        fucking Nightmare. Why? Scared a twenty-one year old is gonna beat your ass?” His smile faded. His eyes
        narrowed. Obelac laughed. “You know, ever since you showed up at my town, I’ve been itching to beat your ass.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac’s heart was thumping in his chest. He was mad, yes, but he didn’t expect himself to be as mad as he
        currently was. He supposed it was the growing combination of all the anger that had begun to well up ever since
        Dane had died. Dane’s death, Nerd’s involvement, and now this. He needed to let out steam. He needed to kill him
        as fast and as painfully as possible so that he could help Chinatsu.
        <br><br>
        <p style="color: maroon;"><b><i>"Listen to me."</b></i></p>
        <br><br>
        The voice spoke again. He ignored it as he rushed forward, and Lucius rushed to meet him. The second Kindred’s
        rapier bit air as Obelac grabbed his wrist and gripped hard. He felt bone crunch as Lucius grit his teeth.
        Obelac twisted, then pulled. A pop filled the air. Lucius winced and slammed his fist into Obelac’s stomach. He
        coughed up blood but kept going as he kicked at Lucius’ knee. The Second Kindred fell down and Obelac kept his
        grip on his arm. With a downward kick he sent Lucius’ against the ground and stomped on the back of his head,
        his face pressed into the stone road. Obelac kept his grip on his wrist as he kept pulling. There was a crunch
        and the sound of flesh tearing as he tore the Kindred’s arm clean off.
        <br><br>
        Blood spilled onto Lucius, yet Obelac was not done. He kicked his opponent, the force sending him flying into
        the air. Obelac launched up to meet him, and using his own severed arm he slammed him back down into the ground.
        His arm was obliterated from the blow, and as Obelac landed he tossed it aside. Lucius’ stump began to regrow
        already, but Obelac wouldn’t let him.
        <br><br>
        <p style="color: maroon;"><b><i>"Listen to me."</b></i></p>
        <br><br>
        Lucius screamed. His body began to pulse, his skin writhed, and with his scream came another release of
        dark-moonlight. Obelac was sent flying back and was forced to catch himself. He landed and recovered quickly.
        Across from him Lucius was regenerating. His face was still caked in dirt as he moved to wipe it clean. A split
        second later he was in front of Obelac. He had gotten faster somehow, and Obelac was forced to grab his blade
        with his bare hand. He bled, but despite that he kept holding on. Obelac looked around him and saw that their
        battle was already destroying large sections of the district they were in.
        <br><br>
        No matter what, he couldn’t allow for a recreation of Tokyo. Lucius was strong, but Obelac couldn’t let that
        hamper him. He needed to win.
        <br><br>
        The First Kindred surrounded his arm with two circles of dark-moonlight and punched forward. This was something
        he had devised on his own, a very way to increase the power of his strikes. His fist caved in Lucius’ stomach
        and would send him careening toward a building with an explosion. Obelac raced to intercept, and he arrived
        right as Lucius would land and uppercutted him into the air, another explosion releasing from the blow.
        <br><br>
        <p style="color: maroon;"><b><i>"Listen to me."</b></i></p>
        <br><br>
        His head pulsed with a brief pain. “Shit…this damn Nightmare…must be infecting me…”
        <br><br>
        Right as Obelac was about to head to Chinatsu he felt a sharp pain in his stomach. He looked down and saw a hole
        there. As he looked back into the sky, he’d see Lucius crashing back down at him. The Second Kindred landed, his
        eyes full of a manic fury. Obelac sensed the sudden spike of Cursed Energy from him and knew what it meant. He
        saw Lucius’ hands move into a sign, and he hastily moved to counter.
        <br><br>
        “<b><i>DOMAIN EXPANSION!</b></i>” they shouted in unison.
