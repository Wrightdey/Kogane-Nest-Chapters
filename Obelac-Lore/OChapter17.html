        <br><h1>Chapter Seventeen: With My Crippled Legs</h1><br>

        <br><hr><br>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
        Obelac had intended on calling Kara Smithson, a Fourteenth Kindred and one of the Isle of Lamia’s Teleportation Division officers. He intended on getting someone to teleport him to Tokyo so he could track KT down himself and figure out just what the hell had happened. He had intended on interrogating KT, and if worst came to worst, kill him. Even if he might not have been able to hold his own, he fully intended to kill him, however all those plans went out the window when he heard the doorbell ring. 
        <br><br>
        Obelac went to answer, and saw a person he didn’t expect. A six foot tall young man with skin a touch lighter than his own, white spiky hair, and gray eyes stood outside the door. He wore all black: a black jacket, black jeans, and black boots. He looked down at Obelac with a passive expression. Obelac opened the door. 
        <br><br>
        “Hello…” Obelac stated, looking at his fellow Sorcerer. 
        <br><br>
        “You got the letter, I take it?” 
        <br><br>
        Right as Obelac was about to confirm this, he was suddenly pushed aside by Chinatsu as she forced herself through. “Hello, what the hell are you doing here?”
        <br><br>
        “I’m here to take Obelac to KT,” Hello stated as he turned his gaze to Chinatsu. “And hey, Chinatsu.”
        <br><br>
        “Hey,” Chinatsu said briefly, and Obelac began to wonder just how the two knew each other. 
        <br><br>
        “Wait, why do you wanna take me to him?” Obelac asked. 
        <br><br>
        “You’re the only other person I can really trust. Lime, Claw, Africa, Nerd…I don’t trust them at all. And besides, you’re strong enough…” 
        <br><br>
        Hello looked Obelac over as he said that, and he felt more like a piece of meat under his gaze than another living being. He brushed the small part of disgust to the side as he narrowed his eyes. 
        <br><br>
        “You expect a fight?”
        <br><br>
        “It’s possible,” Hello stated. “You in?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac sighed, then nodded. “Yeah…I am.” 
        <br><br>
        “Take me with you,” Chinatsu interjected. 
        <br><br>
        Hello blinked. “...huh?”
        <br><br>
        “Take me with you,” she repeated, nearly demanding Hello to do so. The sorcerer shrugged. 
        <br><br>
        “Why do you wanna come?” Obelac asked. A part of him knew why, so she could see just what happened, yet another feared what she might do to KT if she saw him. 
        <br><br>
        “Does it matter?” she deflected. He felt a sense of dread at the idea of prodding any further, so he just decided not to. Hello placed his hands on Obelac’s and Chinatsu’s shoulders, and in less than a second their surroundings would change. They’d find themselves in a frozen wasteland where a city once stood. Obelac’s heart dropped at the sight as he took in the sight of everything. Everything was frozen solid. 
        <br><br>
        “What could’ve done this…” Hello asked himself, his tone more curious than anything else. Obelac looked across to Chinatsu, and he saw her knees visibly shake. 
        <br><br>
        “What…what the fuck…?” Chinatsu asked aloud, her eyes wide as she took a step forward into the terrain. “I…how could…” 
        <br><br>
        Obelac reached out to hold Chinatsu’s hand, and she bit her lip before she wretched her hand from his grasp. Obelac felt his heart sink. Chinatsu took a deep breath, and from her own shadow the Shikigami Nue would manifest. It towered over the three and soon took into the air, its beating wings caused ice shards to crack and the ground to split open as it soon took into the sky. 
        <br><br>
        Obelac sighed as he looked around at the sight before him, appalled at everything. It was like a scene out of a fantasy. Like the Lands Beyond the Wall in a Game of Thrones, or even the Ice King’s domain from Adventure Time. A domain of pure ice and emptiness, where no life nor warmth could be born. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu took a step forward, still in her white polka-dot pajamas and gray fluffy slippers. She didn’t seem affected by the cold around her as she moved inside. 
        <br><br>
        “We have to be quick,” Hello said as he followed. “Ren and the others haven’t arrived yet, but we can’t take all day.” 
        <br><br>
        “I know,” Chinatsu said as she followed Nue’s path. They passed through frozen playgrounds and schools, and walked past frozen skeletons. Obelac watched Chinatsu clench her fist as her breathing heavied, the wisps of her breath visible in the chill air. He felt himself reach out to her hand, but pulled away. The three used Cursed Energy to prevent themselves from slipping on the ice by keeping their footing solid on the ground beneath them. Nue’s wings beat hard above them as they soon came to its location, and in front of them was a passed out KT. 
        <br><br>
        “There he is…” Hello said as he approached. KT’s hair had wisps of white, and his clothes were absolutely tattered. There was a sword encased in ice beside him, and no sight of Dane or anyone else. “Obelac, help me get him up.” 
        <br><br>
        Obelac complied, and they sat KT up and leaned him against a pillar of ice. He slowly opened his eyes, and Obelac noticed they were a light blue. He looked at the three, and didn’t say anything and simply looked down. 
        <br><br>
        “KT,” Hello began. “Are you alright?”
        <br><br>
        He didn’t answer. 
        <br><br>
        “KT. We need you to answer us,” Obelac said. 
        <br><br>
        He didn’t answer. 
        <br><br>
        “Did you do all this?” Chinatsu asked. 
        <br><br>
        KT looked up at her and nodded, and neither Obelac nor Hello could foresee just what would happen next. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu slammed KT’s head through the pillar of ice, and in less time than one could blink she was upon him. He was slumped against the remainder of the pillar as Chinatsu wailed on him. Her fists flew through the air and collided with his face in a flurry of blows as he simply laid there. Blow after blow after brutal blow resulted in his limp body twitching. His head was knocked back and forth as blood and teeth poured from his mouth.
        <br><br>
        Obelac moved from his paralytic surprise as he reached out to grab Chinatu’s arm once it was drawn back, the blood that coated it made him lose his grip as she wretched free and slammed KT’s face into the ground. Obelac saw an eye pop out as he crumpled onto the floor. Obelac grit his teeth as he now grabbed Chinatsu’s arms and forcefully pulled her back. She tried to wrestle free, Cursed Energy flaring around her as she began wailing in anger. Tears rolled down her face. “Let go of me!” she demanded of Obelac, her fists slick with KT’s blood. “Get the fuck off me! He did this! He killed them! He has to fucking PAY!” 
        <br><br>
        “We have to learn more!” Obelac protested as Chinatsu tried to wrestle free of him. Darkness swelled around them as it rose up and began to swallow entire buildings in shadow. Hello looked around them as the darkness began to spread out from Chinatsu and began to climb up Obelac’s legs. Obelac looked down, and his red eyes widened in shock. “Ch-Chinatsu, calm down!”
        <br><br>
        The rage of the Black Silence only grew as she tried to escape Obelac’s grasp, and a gust of wind would knock the both of them back as Nue began to descend down on the group. It landed in a crash, shards of ice splittering and shooting all around it. Hello batted aside the ones that headed toward Obelac, Chinatsu, and KT. Nue looked down at them, its gaze almost sizing them up as its eyes narrowed. 
        <br><br>
        “Chinatsu!” Obelac shouted as the shadows began to creep up his legs, almost engulfing them. He felt cold, a deep chill run down his spine as he bit his lip to try and control his instincts. “Calm down! Y-you’re hurting me!” 
        <br><br>
        She didn’t hear him, yet the shadows would recede as she began to stop fighting back. Her eyes were red with tears and her face was stained with tears. The look she was was one of sheer murderous hatred, her pupils dilated and teeth bared, and yet she stopped struggling. She wretched herself free from Obelac, then once she turned around she saw the look of fear in his eyes. Her wrathful expression quickly morphed into one of horror. 
        <br><br>
        “I…I…”
        <br><br>
        Nue beat its wings as it looked down at them. 
        <br><br>
        “Are you alright…?” Obelac asked. 
        <br><br>
        “I…I…I’m sorry…” she said as she began to wipe her tears from her face. “I’m so fucking…I..” 
        <br><br>
        She was unable to finish her words, and instead took a deep breath. “I-I n-need some space,” she said, and with no further elaboration climbed onto Nue’s back and flew off. Obelac looked at her fly off until he could barely see the Shikigami. He kept looking up at they sky for what felt like hours, his heart thumping in his chest, until he then looked down at KT’s battered and near unrecognizable face. KT was struggling to breathe as he lay slumped against the cold floor. His blood stained the ice beneath him, and Obelac saw no emotion behind his eyes. Hello bent down and began to output RCT to heal him, and as he did Obelac slumped down against a well, his legs giving out. 
        <br><br><br>

        Chinatsu had stood there for a moment until she heard Hello’s voice coming from outside her home. She rushed to the doorframe and saw Obelac standing in the middle of it. She gently shoved him to the side, and saw her cousin’s student standing outside her door. “Hello, what the hell are you doing here?”
        <br><br>
        “I’m here to take Obelac to KT,” Hello stated as he turned his gaze to her . “And hey, Chinatsu.”
        <br><br>
        “Hey,” she said briefly, pushing past the brief introductory.  
        <br><br>
        “Wait, why do you wanna take me to him?” Obelac asked suddenly, and Chinatsu glanced at him. 
        <br><br>
        “You’re the only other person I can really trust. Lime, Claw, Africa, Nerd…I don’t trust them at all. And besides, you’re strong enough…” 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu noticed Hello’s tone, and saw his eyes look over Obelac, and pushed back the urge to slam his face into the concrete. She knew that he had a questionable love of Jujutsu as a whole, which included Cursed Techniques, and she also knew that he must have had a vested interest in her boyfriend due to his capabilities. To Chinatsu, he was a massive pervert in that aspect. 
        <br><br>
        “You expect a fight?”
        <br><br>
        “It’s possible,” Hello stated. “You in?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac sighed, then nodded. “Yeah…I am.” 
        <br><br>
        “Take me with you,” Chinatsu interrupted, glaring at Hello. She absolutely refused to just stay there, not while Tokyo was a frozen wasteland, and not while KT was still out there breathing. She had no idea if she actually did it, but she didn’t know him well enough to say either way. Jujutsu Sorcerers were insane, the most wreckless subsect of supernatural fighters in the world. A number of them were battle junkies who only cared about fighting others and nothing else in life, a complete and total band of social rejects. The Zenin was no different. 
        Hello blinked. “...huh?”
        <br><br>
        “Take me with you,” she repeated, nearly demanding Hello to do so. He shrugged, probably too annoyed or unwilling to deny. 
        <br><br>
        “Why do you wanna come?” Obelac asked. She was shocked that he had to ask, but also figured he didn’t want to point out why. She knew he must’ve known, and that he didn’t want to confirm with her out of some sense of hesitancy. 
        <br><br>
        “Does it matter?” she deflected. Obelac didn’t respond, and Hello placed his hands on their shoulders. In less than a second their surroundings would change, and they would find themselves in a frozen wasteland where a city once stood. Chinatsu’s blood ran cold as she stared at Tokyo, her heart still in her chest as her eyes widened in pure, abject horror. “What…what the fuck…? I…how could…” 
        <br><br>
        She felt something take hold of her hand, and hastily pulled away as she began to shudder with fear, despair, anger, hatred, and every single negative emotion possible for a human to experience. She hastily interlaced her fingers and called forth Nue, desperate to find the source of all this.. To find KT. The Shikigami flew into the air, its powerful wings beating down hard as it traveled onward. 
        <br><br>
        “We have to be quick,” Hello said as he followed. “Ren and the others haven’t arrived yet, but we can’t take all day.” 
        <br><br>
        “I know,” Chinatsu snapped, narrowing her eyes as she hurried alongside Obelac and Hello. She kept following Nue, and everything she saw only filled her with genuine bloodlust. Everything was frozen, every single thing was frozen solid, inhospitable to any form of life. 
        <br><br>
        She passed throught streets that she once walked down with her classmates. Shops and restaurants that her senpai and sensei had shown her. She remembered they had shown her a small restaurant that sold crepes, and how she had gotten addicted to them. She remembered how her senpai, Ayase Inumaki, had bought her several pairs of shoes as a thank you for saving her. 
        <br><br>
        Nue had stopped above them, perching atop a building as they came to their destination. KT was in front of them, a sword encased in ice behind him. KT was passed out, his clothes torn and his body covered in bruises. 
        <br><br>
        “There he is…” she heard Hello say. He approached KT.“Obelac, help me get him up.” 
        Chinatsu watched in silence as they helped him up, her heart now beating with an unbearable force. 
        <br><br>
        “KT,” Hello began. “Are you alright?”
        <br><br>
        No answer. 
        <br><br>
        “KT. We need you to answer us,” Obelac said. 
        <br><br>
        No answer. 
        <br><br>
        “Did you do all this?” Chinatsu asked. 
        <br><br>
        KT looked up at her and nodded. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu’s body reacted before her mind did, and she slammed KT’s head through a pillar of ice. She then kept it up, the rage, anger, hurt, and pain overwhelming her as she began wailing on him. Cursed Energy infused punches slammed into his face again and again as he let out not even a whimper or grunt of pain. Blood coated her fists as she kept beating on him. Her arms grew heavy as she felt her eyes water. 
        <br><br>
        Flashes of her past ran in the back of her head, memories with those who now had surely died. Her teachers, friends, allies, comrades, all those who met their end in a frozen blizzard. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu kept going, panting as she saw his teeth fly from his mouth. She saw as an eye popped out, and that didn’t dissuade her in the slightest. She kept pounding her fists into his face again and again and again, a pool of blood forming from his mouth and re-opened bruises. 
        <br><br>
        When she raised her arm to punch him again, she felt a hand catch her arm, and with a quick but strenuous effort she pulled free and punched him again, making him crumple to the floor. 
        <br><br>
        Right as she was about to stomp his face into a bloody paste she felt someone grab her arms and pull her back. She screamed, and Cursed Energy surged within her to the point it emitted a visible black aura. 
        <br><br>
        “Let go of me!” she demanded, her fists slick with KT’s blood. “Get the fuck off me! He did this! He killed them! He has to fucking PAY!” 
        <br><br>
        She was sure Obelac said something, but whatever he said she couldn’t properly hear. She struggled to try and escape from his grasp, her rage overflowing as she felt a sudden surge of strength. 
        <br><br>
        All she saw was black. A pitch black nothingness that swallowed her senses and obliterated her thoughts. 
        <br><br>
        Agony. Hatred. Malice. Despair. Wrath. Fury. These wisps of color dotted her vision as she struggled to break free of her confines. These red, white, orange, and blue dots of color grew more and more as she raged, as her amber overtook her, and as her silent scream of rage began to engulf her soul. 
        <br><br>
        She heard a thing. A word. A few words. Nothing that she fully computed. Nothing she fully understood. Nothing she wanted to understand. All that mattered in that moment was blood. Revenge. Justice.  
        <br><br>
        Justice. Justice. Justice. 
        <br><br>
        Flashes of her friends flew by. 
        <br><br>
        Justice. 
        <br><br>
        Memories of some of the happiest days she ever had flew by. 
        <br><br>
        Justice. 
        <br><br>
        Memories of her, for once in her life, feeling true happiness. 
        <br><br>
        Vengeance. 
        <br><br>
        The darkness within her heart swelled more and more as the strength she had left her limbs. She panted heavily as she looked around frantically. Her strength had been spent, and her vision returned fully. Her eyes were wide, and she grit her teeth as the shadows within her kept stirring with vengeance. 
        <br><br>
        She saw him, then. Scared, frightened, worried, terrified, and the look of that on his face, caused by her, made her heart shatter into nothingness. 
        <br><br>
        “I…I…”
        <br><br>
        A weak stammer left her lips as she looked at the man she loved. She felt tears run down her eyes as the murderous rage she had moments before evaporated into thin air. 
        <br><br>
        “Are you alright…?” he asked. 
        <br><br>
        “I…I…I’m sorry…” she said as she began to wipe her tears from her face. “I’m so fucking…I..” 
        <br><br>
        She needed air. She needed space. She needed to scream and vent in a place that he wouldn’t see. She needed to leave. She needed to make sure he didn’t see the monster she would become if she was within spitting distance of KT. 
        <br><br>

        “I-I n-need some space.” 
        <br><br>
        She hastily, frantically, flew onto Nue’s back, and without a word the Shikigami took off. 
        <br><br>
        Never before in her life had Chinatsu Zenin wanted to die as much as then. 
        <br><br><br>

                Interlude: Laeticia Jaynelle
                <br><br>
                ~Arbiter of the Isle~
                <br><br>
            </i>
        </div>

        Laeticia let out a deep sigh as she sat down at her desk. Her hair was discheveled, her eyes had bags under them, and she buried her face in her hands as her mind raced for answers. Jason Sreng, the Fifteenth Kindred and one of the three people on the Isle who had a shapeshifting Cursed Technique, had vanished entirely. Jia Yuanchun and Artemis Haevyn were both found innocent of framing Daniel Atkins, and the only logical conclusion would be that Jason was responsible. That brought a further question of who else was responsible for the crime. Was his sire, Hope Williams responsible? Or was their grand-sire, Lucius responsible? 
        <br><br>
        Those Second Kindred who are the last remaining of their blood-stream, Kindred like Her and Lucius, were considered to be progenitors of those who continued to bear the blood of the First Kindred that sired them all. With Fulgur the Phoenix dead, Lucius was the de facto head of that lineage of Vampires. Even those few descended from Fulgur that he didn’t sire still owed their allegiance to him. 
        <br><br>
        Laeticia knew Lucius. He was an honorable, respectable Vampire who acted with pride for his station and his people. She didn’t know why he would commit treason, nor could she think of a reason. 
        <br><br>
        That was, of course, assuming he was indeed guilty. 
        <br><br>
        Though, now that she thought of it, she did not recall the last time she saw Lucius. Indeed, it had been a while since she last saw him with her own eyes. 
        <br><br>
        Laeticia was taken from her thoughts by a knock on her door, and the last person she expected entered through. 
        <br><br>
        Lionel Harlow, the First Kindred, had entered. He was dressed smartly, wearing a white button up with dark blue slacks and dark blue dress shoes. He held a bottle of wine in one hand, and two wine glasses in the other. 
        <br><br>
        Laeticia eyed him curiously. “What brings you here?” she asked him. He didn’t reply, instead he placed the bottle down gently on her desk, alongside the two glasses. He sat down gently in front of her. 
        <br><br>
        “I’ve heard you havent left your quarters in hours,” he said. “Which you only do when your mind is struggling to uncover something.” 
        <br><br>
        She watched as he poured himself and her a glass, and gently pushed the glass toward her. She took it and gulped it down in seconds, not even taking a moment to savor its taste. 
        <br><br>
        “I have been,” she said. “What I’ve been able to uncover…it does not bode well.” 
        <br><br>
        “How so?”
        <br><br>
        “The evidence points to Lucius, or someone else, planning things in secret. Daniel Atkins was framed for selling our information to Jussom Inc, and of the only three among us who could change their form and residuals to match his, the one descended from Lucius has vanished.” 
        <br><br>
        “I see…” Lionel said as he poured Laeticia another glass. He crossed his legs as he leaned back into the seat. “And yet Vespasian Fulgurite, another scion of Lucius, had discovered this.” 
        <br><br>
        “I know,” Laeticia said. “Either he is complicit, or innocent in all this. But either way, it begs the question of why would he do this? He has no reason to cause disharmony among us, no reason to cause disorder and treason.” 
        <br><br>
        “That we know of,” Lionel said. “He has a history of open conflict with Obelac, a contention that others have to foster as well.”
        <br><br>
        Laeticia narrowed her eyes at that. “Do I sense a sly jab, Lionel?”
        <br><br>
        “Do you?” he asked as he sipped his wine. 
        <br><br>
        “You do not put me in the same place as a potential traitor, do you?” 
        <br><br>
        “I do not,” he said. “I am simply stating the fact that my little brother has gotten the ire of those older and more influential than he is. And for him to have power over others like Lucius, I fear that is starting to make others question the edict of Filial Piety.”
        <br><br>
        “Blasphemy,” she said, waving her hand dismissively. 
        <br><br>
        “Maybe so, but it is our fault as well that we waited until now to try and help him.” 
        <br><br>
        Laeticia averted her gaze at that. “Hm. Better now than never.” 
        <br><br>
        “How has his progress been, if I may ask.” 
        <br><br>
        “Slow. He is rude, reckless, and has no sense of respect. He is strong, but strength is all he has. I do not know what role he could play among us. None at all.” 
        <br><br>
        “I see,” Lionel said as he took another sip. 
        <br><br>
        Laeticia sighed. “We must get to the bottom of this,” she said. “Before this comes back to bite us when we least expect it.” 
        <br><br>

                Interlude: Argalia Grayson
                <br><br>
                ~The Blue Reverberation~
                <br><br>
            </i>
        </div>

        Argalia sat there motionless in the headquarters of the Monster Hunter Association. He was in his private office. His hair was let down, and he wore a blue polo shirt and white pants. The television in front of him reported on the only thing every news station was reporting. Tokyo, for whatever rhyme or reason, had been completely frozen. Everything was frozen, and the television rattled off a list of casualties.
        <br><br>
        “<i>...Dane Simonson, Gojo Yura, Gojo Jozu, Gojo Fuyuhiko, Gojo Katami-</i>”
        The list of Gojo clan members rattled on to no end, yet that was not important. His fiance and their unborn child were in Tokyo. She was visiting there to see her parents, and he would have met her the day after. 
        <br><br>
        More and more names rattled on as his chest pounded in his chest, and he prayed to a god he didn’t believe that she would’ve been safe. 
        <br><br>
        “<i>Hamada Aki, Hamada Asa, Hashimoto Katagiri, Hashimoto Hattori, Hashimoto Genichi, Hayakawa Hiyumi-</i>”
        <br><br>
        Argalia felt his mouth dry as he heard her name. He sat there, his world turning black.
        <br><br>
        Hiyumi Hayakawa. 
        <br><br>
        Hiyumi Hayakawa.
        <br><br>
        Hiyumi Hayakawa.
        <br><br>
        The woman he loved more than anyone else. 
        <br><br>
        She was dead. 
        <br><br>
        His child was dead. 
        <br><br>
        He had nothing to live for anymore. 
        <br><br>
        He wanted to be with her. He was willing to put everything behind him if it meant he could be with her, and yet he wouldn’t be able to. 
        <br><br>
        She was dead.
        <br><br>
        Their son was dead.
        <br><br>
        Dead. 
        <br><br>
        Dead. 
        <br><br>
        Argalia had seen death before plenty of times. He had seen plenty of Vampires die at his hands, those disgusting <i>things</i> daring to sink their disgusting, rotten fangs into the necks of those who actually deserved their existence. He loved putting them in their place. He loved pulling their fangs from their mouth one by one, to see if he could do it before they regenerated. He loved seeing how fast he could dismember them, and how long they could withstand torture. And he was willing to put that love behind him for Hiyumi.
        <br><br>
        Now, that would never come to pass. 
        <br><br>
        She was dead.
        <br><br>
        He was dead.
        <br><br>
        They were dead. 
        <br><br>
        Dead. 
        <br><br>
        Gone. 
        <br><br>
        There was truly no reason to continue. The only thing that could fuel him would be the slaughter of vampires, the death of every single one of them, yet he knew he wasn’t strong enough for that. He was weak. Far too weak. He could not match Lionel, let alone Brunestud. 
        <br><br>
        He would die in the attempt. Was that such a bad thing? It was. He refused to let those vermin kill him. Only a human should have the right to kill him. 
        <br><br>
        But who? 
        <br><br>
        His wife was dead.
        <br><br>
        His son was dead.
        <br><br>
        And he would soon join them. 
        <br><br>
        Argalia had a plethora of weapons in his office, mostly trophies he took from those accursed vampires he had slain. He procured a hammer from a Second Kindred he had framed for treason, and who he had taken his time with murdering. He had a pair of flintlock pistols that were imbued with a bullet-tracing Cursed Technique. He even had a shield that could deflect attacks. He wouldn’t sully his blood with that accursed steel. No. He would use his scythe. 
        <br><br>
        Argalia stood up, his eyes empty and lifeless as he walked over to his weapon, his beautiful, master-crafted weapon that far outshone anything the vermin he hunted could create. 
        <br><br>
        He could still see Hiyumi’s face, even then. Her soft, beautiful skin. Her chestnut hair, her beautiful brown eyes and the smile that melted his heart whenever he saw her. He could still recall when he proposed to her, the first time he went onto his knee for another, the first time he showed that level of respect and reverence for someone. The first time he wanted to be a protector, a true protector. She was like the sun to him, and he was pulled in her orbit whenever he was with her. 
        <br><br>
        Argalia placed the blade to his throat. His breathing was steady. He was not nervous, nor did any semblance of a will to live try and intervene. He closed his eyes, envisioning his life, the son they never had, and a soft, wry smile came across his lips. 
        <br><br>
        He pulled back, and Argalia cut his own neck. 
        <br><br>
        The sensation of his blood spilling from his neck was bliss like no other. He felt a weight pull off his shoulders as he laid against the wall and slowly slumped down, and that smile stayed on his lips. 
        <br><br>
        He could see her. He could see them. Both of them. His wife and child as his life slowly vanished from his eyes. He could hear her voice, he could see her hand reach out to him, and he reached out to her, eager to feel her warmth.
        <br><br>
        Only for him to be pulled away. 
        <br><br>
        Argalia’s eyes snapped wide open. He was in his office, a pool of blood all around him. He slowly rose up as his neck throbbed with pain, and as he did his eyes settled on a woman. She was small, and had long black hair and red eyes. She wore a white dress coat with a black button up shirt and a white skirt. Her skin was as white as snow, yet she didn’t give off the feeling of a Vampire, nor was she a Cursed Spirit. No, he knew what she was. 
        <br><br>
        “Hello there,” she smiled. She placed her arms behind her as she looked up at the man. “I took the liberty of bringing you back.”
        <br><br>
        He grit his teeth, ignoring the nonesense the woman was spewing as he began to use RCT to heal his wounds-
        <br><br>
        “<strong><i>SHIT!</i></strong>”
        <br><br>
        Argalia screamed out in pain as his neck throbbed even more, and his knees grew weak as he gasped and fell to his knees. He looked up at the woman. “What the hell did you do?”
        <br><br>
        She bent down, meeting him at eye level. “I offered you a second chance,” she said. “There’s something brewing in the Isle of Lamia, a bunch of Vampires all fighting to the death, and you’ll be able to kill as many of them as you want, before they kill you.” 
        <br><br>
        He scoffed. “And why should I trust you?”
        <br><br>
        “Because, there’s not much else for you to do now, as a Vengeful Spirit.” 
        <br><br>
        Argalia’s eyes widened, and he bolted to his feet. The woman did the same, and he looked down at her with an ungodly rage. 
        <br><br>
        “You…” 
        <br><br>
        He knew what she was, he encountered enough whenever he shadowed Chinatsu. This thing before him was a Nightmare, one that looked disgustingly similar to a vampire.
        <br><br>
        “My name is Carmine,” she smiled. “Let us seek evolution together, Argalia.”
