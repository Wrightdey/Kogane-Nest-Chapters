    <div id="content">
        <h3>Among the three million registered Sorcerers, around thirty of them held the title of Special Grade. Among those great few, Obelac stood among them as the seventh strongest Special Grade sorcerer. He did this based solely on his own innate capabilities as a First Kindred, a vampire sired by the originator of the species. He had no innate Cursed Technique, though he was sure he’d unlock one with time. He had nothing special other than his pure fundamentals, yet it was this that made him a formidable opponent. There was potential for him to be even stronger, but that required him to feast on human blood, something he absolutely refused to do no matter what. He was fine where he was, even if others surpassed him one day.</h3>
        <h3>As it stood, he was currently relaxing in a small cafe in the town he had resided in for the past year or so. The people there were nice, and he had found a routine. Every day on the dot, he’d visit this cafe to prepare himself for the day. Once he left, he’d patrol, watching out for Cursed Spirits or other monsters and deal with them. In the rare instance he was given assignments from Jujutsu Headquarters, he’d prepare to embark on a mission that would more likely than not be a life and death battle.</h3>
        <h3>Obelac sipped his tea, closing his eyes as he cleared his thoughts. It had been years since he last saw Brunestud. He suspected she was still in her forest, but he had no intention of visiting her. Frankly, he was too scared to do so. He feared what might happen if they saw eachother, what he might do to her, or what she might do to him.</h3>
        <h3>Another sip brought back memories of when they’d huddle close to the fire, watching the stars in the night sky. His heart ached, and he placed the cup down. The young man let out a loud sigh, as if trying to push these memories out of his body. He got out of his seat, taking the cup with him as he left the cafe, waving goodbye to the barista as he did. The sunlight didn’t impede him, due to his status as a higher Kindred. Any lesser vampire would be weakened or dead from direct exposure to the sun. He walked on. Aimlessly, just enoying the warmth of the sun on his face.</h3>
        <h3>His peace was interrupted by his phone buzzing in his pocket. As he took it out, he saw that he was given an assignment by Jujutsu Headquarters</h3>
        <h3>Surrounding the town was a forest, one that was teeming with animals. He often went hunting with a certain group of men from the town's bar. He still didn't know their names, but they practically adopted him as a little brother. He didn't dislike that.</h3>
        <h3>As he walked throguh the forest, Obelac noticed that the normally vibrant and loud forest was replaced by dead silence. His eyes narrowed as he slowly walked forward. He looked around and couldn't see any animals and assumed they hid in terror of the Cursed Spirit that lurked within.</h3>
        <h3>With each step he took, his heart beat in his chest more and more in anticipation. He took a deep breath as he familiarized himself with his surroundings. The trees stretched high into the sky, the ground beneath his feet were littered with decomposing leaves, and there were no animal remains that would alert him to any violent activities.</h3>
        <h3>As he walked through the forest, Obelac narrowed his eyes as he felt a sudden spike of Cursed Energy. He walked toward it, and soon came across his target. The Curse was tall and lanky, pale white skin and dressed in a white suit. Black tendrils protruded from their back, and their face was featureless. It had no mouth to speak with, but every second it stood still, the noise of static came from it.</h3>
        <h3>The next second, Obelac slammed his fist into this creature’s stomach, while its tendrils stabbed him through the chest. This didn’t hinder him, nor even hurt him. Obelac had Reverse Cursed Technique, and his already potent healing allowed him to regenerate instantaneously from any wound he endured.</h3>
        <h3>The next two seconds were filled with dozens of strikes from Obelac, his fists flew through the air as he bombarded the Cursed Spirit with a flurry of blows. He took note of the creature’s hands, its tendrils, and made sure that it had no chance to use a Domain. His own Simple Domain would be nothing but a stalling method.</h3>
        <h3>The Curse flew through dozens of trees, and Obelac chased after it as he soon appeared behind the beast, clenched his fist then slammed it through the monster’s back. It didn’t scream, and Obelac didn’t give it the opportunity to cry out. He used his free hand to grab the beast’s face, and with little effort tore its head from its body. Blood spurted out as itt was lifted only by Obelac’s fist through its chest. He dislodged his arm from it, and the body fell to the ground. Obealc crushed the skull in his hand, watching as the curse faded away.</h3>
        <h3>Naturally, it was easy. He hadn't come across a threat that actually pushed him. And he doubted he ever would.</h3>
        <h3>He made his way back to the town and decided to head to the bar. As he entered, he’d notice someone that he hadn’t met before. Usually, there would be a handful of regulars. The portly construction worker Paul, the waifer-thin honors student Cedrick, the always loud frat boy with a podcast-Jason. The new face among them was a tall, pale skinned man with blonde hair. He was dressed in a blue business suit, and was downing shots like there was no tomorrow. He seemed to notice his presence, turning to Obelac.</h3>
        <h3>"<i>I thought I'd find you here,</i>" he said. Obelac noticed the man's pronounced fangs, and his eyes narrowed.</h3>
        <h3>"<em>What the hell are you doing here,</em>" he snapped. The bartender, Luis, raised a brow at this.</h3>
        <h3>"<em>You know this guy?</em>" Luis asked.</h3>
        <h3>"<em>I know of people like him.</em>"</h3>
        <h3>"<em>This... that business stuff you don't tell anyone about?</em>"</h3>
        <h3>"<em>Somewhat.</em>"</h3>
        <h3>Luis sighed, and the man laughed.</h3>
        <h3>"<em>Don't mind him. He's just apprehensive about meeting family,</em>" the stranger teased.</h3>
        <h3>"<em>We aren't family</em>"</h3>
        <h3>The man got up from his seat, towering over Obelac. He was around six and a half feet tall, and wore a grin. He placed a hand on Obelac's shoulder.</h3>
        <h3>"<em>Let us speak outside,</em>" he said, practically forcing him out. Once they left the bar, the man let go of his shoulder, stepping back. "<em>Ah. Fresh air. The warmth of the sun...</em>"</h3>
        <h3>"<em>Who the hell are you,</em>" Obelac demanded. The man smiled.</h3>
        <h3>"<em>I am a Second Kindred,</em>" he said. "<em>Sired far before your birth, by a Kindred who no longer walks this world. Fulger, though I doubt you'd know his legend. My name is Lucius</em>"</h3>
        <h3>"<em>And what the hell do you want?</em>"</h3>
        <h3>He looked Obelac up and down. “<em>I want to know why you waste your time with these meatbags,</em>” he said, a hand on his hip. “<em>A Vampire becoming a Sorcerer, the group that would hunt our kind? Shameful. The Great Progenitor-</em>”</h3>
        <h3>Obelac didn’t even process his fist as it flew through the air and slammed into Lucius’ face. By the time he realized what he had done, the Second Kindred had stumbled back and growled as he held his jaw. He looked at Lucius, his brown eyes filled with rage.</h3>
        <h3>"<em>Speak about her like you know her, and I swear I'll fucking kill you,</em>" he spat, his words were dipped in nothing but pure venom. Lucius clenched his fist.</h3>
        <h3>"<em>Foolish child,</em>"" he spat. "<em>Someone of your stature has no business being among these... <b>fleshsacks!</b> But of course you spend time with these wretches and not your own kind.</em>"</h3>
        <h3>"<i>Shut. Up.</i>"</h3>
        <h3>Vampires had a law, one of Filial Piety. A Higher Kindred was to be respected by a Lower Kindred. According to such rules, Lucius was to be subservient to Obelac, despite being more than a few hundred years older than him. Lucius’ vampiric red eyes glared at Obelac, before backing away.</h3>
        <h3>"<i>Very well, oh ignorant child,</i>" he said with a smirk. "<i>Keep denying your heritage. Squander your gifts. Die for a bunch of vagrants who would reject you should they know your true nature.</i>"</h3>
        <h3>With these words he walked away, and obelac suppresed the urge to kill him then and there.</h3>
