        <br><h1>Chapter Thirteen: I Am Your Biggest Fan</h1><br>

        <br><hr><br>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
        It was 12:00 A.M on the dot as Obelac arrived at Laeticia’s villa. She had switched out of her earlier dress into a business suit. She wore a black jacket, a white button up and a black skirt with heels. Obelac himself wore a red button up with black slacks and dress shoes. Laeticia looked him over. “Hm. Acceptable,” she said. “What you’ll be doing today is shadowing me in what I do. As the head of the Division of Laws, my rulings are the one's that allow our society to flourish. I have no doubt that you have little appreciation for what that entails, and so you’ll be there to see first hand how we handle our rules.” 
        <br><br>
        Obelac simply nodded, and Laeticia narrowed her eyes. “Use your words. You were blessed with a functioning set of lungs and vocal cords. Use them.” 
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, sure.” 
        <br><br>
        “Take that sass out of your tone. Speak plainly and respectfully. You are no longer a First Kindred, not now. You are my subordinate, and you will behave as they do. Unless you prefer me to add onto your tasks.”
        <br><br>
        “...Alright…” 
        <br><br>
        “No. Yes ma’am. I will not accept anything else.” 
        <br><br>
        “Yes ma’am.” he spat. She glared at him. 
        <br><br>
        “Do not think I don’t hear your annoyance. This is your punishment, to be at my side as I show you what a Moonlight Lord should do. I volunteered myself for this not because I dislike you, but because I believe myself to be the only person able to teach you in the way you need to be taught. Your hatred of our people, your single-mindedness hatred toward Cursed Spirits, your inexperience and passivity all needs to die.” 
        <br><br>
        She took a step closer as her heels clacked against the hardwood floor. She looked him in the eyes, her ruby eyes staring into his blood red. “You are young. You are inexperienced. You will no longer be able to just coast around like a child and expect the respect of adults. I will not allow it. I will not stand for it. Understood?”
        <br><br>
        Obelac was about to nod until he stopped himself. “...yes ma’am.” 
        <br><br>
        “Good,” Laeticia said as she walked past him. Obelac followed after her as they left her study. They walked past her maids and butlers as they all tidied up. He could tell that some were vampires, while others were humans oddly enough. 
        <br><br>
        “Who are they,” he asked her. 
        <br><br>
        “My subjects,” she said. “Those who ruled under me when I was Queen, and their human descendants.” 
        <br><br>
        “...human descendants?” 
        <br><br>
        “Indeed. Those who didn’t wish to be turned, I took into my estate and allowed for them to assist me. They had their children, who continue to live with me.”
        <br><br>
        “...do they have a choice?”
        <br><br>
        She gave him a look. “Are you implying I’d allow for slavery among us, Obelac?”
        “N-not at all…” he said as he avoided her gaze. 
        <br><br>
        “They can leave if they wish, either to live with another on the isle or to enter the world of humans. Some have, but not most.” 
        <br><br>
        “How come?”
        <br><br>
        She stopped walking and turned to him fully. “Why would they, when it was humanity that caused them to end up where they are today? Had it not been for me, they would not exist to begin with,” she told him. “Those older Kindred among us, even the Great Progenitor, hate humans. We hate those who perseucte us for being the ‘other’. All of us have witnessed the evil inherent in humanity, an evil that they allow to fester and grow like a cancer. Vampires possess that same human evil, yet we punish those who cause harm to our kind. But humans…they allow injustice and evil to fester. It happened with my kingdom, and the things I saw…” Laetica shook her head, as if she were trying to banish something. “If you saw what I saw, you would hate Humanity as well. They haven’t changed in centuries and they never will.”
        <br><br>
        With that she continued on past her butlers and maids, the workers not pausing to listen in on their conversation. They exited through the front doors, and Laeticia would lead Obelac down a brick road.  They passed rows of trees that stretched high into the sky and provided abundant shade in the daytime. There were no lamps to illuminate the night sky, for Vampires didn't need any when they could see just fine in the dark. As they walked, they’d come to a large gothic building that had several people guarding it. They all wore modern day military attire with a riot shield in one arm and a stun baton in the other. Their shields were decorated with different emblems, which Obelac had recognized to belong to varying members of the Moonlight Lords. Specifically the crimson cross of Lionel’s line and the golden lion of Larsen’s line. The guards all bowed as Obelac and Laeticia entered the building. 
        <br><br>
        The interior had a gothic asthetic to it as well. There were high arched columns and magnificent stained glass that depicted moments of the history of their people. The lights were off, and Obelac saw several people working at desks and talking to others. They all stopped what they were doing to bow at the two Kindred. Laeticia eventually led Obelac to a courtoom, where there was no one else. It was the same as a normal Human courtroom, and Laeticia sat at the judges seat. She gestured to her side, and Obelac sat at a level below her. 
        <br><br>
        “So…when is this supposed to start?”
        <br><br>
        “An hour,” she said. Obelac refused the urge to glare at her as he saw Laeticia produce several files from a compartment on the desk. “This trial is for an alleged act against the sanctity of our rules,” she said. “The ruling of secrecy. Familiarize yourself with the case, Obelac,” she told him as she handed him the documents. 
        <br><br>
        Obelac looked them over and saw that the accused was a Fifteenth Kindred by the name of Daniel Atkins, an American vampire who had been alleged of leaking sensitive information to Jussom Inc in return for monetary gain. He frowned at that as a sigh left his lips.
        <br><br>
        “Something the matter?”
        <br><br>
        “No…” he lied. “Nothing.” 
        <br><br>
        “Jussom Nerd is a Jujutsu Sorcerer, is he not?”
        <br><br>
        “He is,” Obelac confirmed. 
        <br><br>
        “Do you know him?”
        <br><br>
        “I do.”
        <br><br>
        “How much?”
        <br><br>
        “He…invited me for dinner one time and we talked about things.” 
        <br><br>
        “What things?”
        <br><br>
        “Nothing important.”
        <br><br>
        She looked at him for a moment before she turned away. Obelac sighed as he leaned back into his seat. “So…how will this work?”
        <br><br>
        “Normally, the accused are given one of my Kindred to act as a lawyer of sorts on their behalf, while the accuser will have much the same. However for something of this magnitude, the result will be different. The accuser and the accused will come and perform a Binding Vow, and under the risk of death or worse, will tell the truth.” 
        <br><br>
        Obelac flipped through the documents to see that the accuser was a Fourth Kindred by the name of Vespasian Fulgurite, who had claimed to overhear a conversation between Daniel and a Jussom Inc informant. A vague transcription of the conversation was given, and Obelac would look through it. To Obelac, if the transcription was true, it was blaringly obvious that Daniel was guilty. 
        <br><br>
        “In that case, why not just do that immediately? Why go through all this?”
        <br><br>
        “The law and our rulings must be upheld with ceremony and decorum,” she said. “No matter what.”
        <br><br>
        “Got it…” Obelac said. “...and if he actually did it?”
        <br><br>
        “Then he will be banished from our land,” she told him. “As those who betray us have no purpose among us.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac figured someone like Laeticia would want them killed, but he also supposed that banishment was a death of its own. 
        <br><br>
        “Got it…” he said. Soon time would pass, and the two had arrived.
        <br><br>
        The trial itself was quick and to the point. Despite the evidence to his guilt, Daniel made the binding vow and proclaimed his innocence. He would be held in confinement until the adverse effects of breaking a Binding Vow with another person would appear. That of course raised the question of if Daniel had not lied, then who was the person that looked and sounded just like him that sold the information. Obelac placed the blame on Nerd somehow. 
        <br><br>
        When that was done, Obelac and Laeticia would return to her estate. 
        <br><br>
        “I have a question,” Obelac said. Laetitia turned to him. 
        <br><br>
        “What is it?”
        <br><br>
        He took a moment before he responded. “I don’t get how this is supposed to help me.” 
        “That’s a statement, not a question.”
        <br><br>
        Obelac resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “It’s still the truth…I don’t get how watching trials is supposed to help me.” 
        <br><br>
        “If you don’t understand, I fear there’s no hope for you.” 
        <br><br>
        “That’s not it,” he said. “I mean…I know why from what you told me, but that’s not really the issue, I think,” 
        <br><br>
        “You hate us, by your own words.”
        <br><br>
        “And you hate humans,” Obelac said. “Would knowing their suffering change that?”
        She looked at him for a moment. “Then are you saying that you’ll never grow to care for your own?”
        <br><br>
        “No! It’s just…do you get why I don’t like vampires?”
        <br><br>
        “The reason doesn’t matter. The fact remains that you dislike your own people.”
        <br><br>
        “Respectfully, that’s bullshit.”
        <br><br>
        “...Excuse me?”
        <br><br>
        The two stopped walking as they looked at each other. “I said that’s bullshit,” he repeated. “You’re acting like I was born this way! I wasn’t. I spent most of my life as a human and became a vampire through means I had absolutely no say or consent in. The only other vampires I interacted with, like you, all seemingly hated me because one thing or another. Lucius appeared at the town where I live and talked shit to my face and bad-mouthed me living with humans. You know nothing about me, and until now didn’t care about actually trying to help me. And now that you’re here you’re talking down at me like I’m a fucking dog.”
        <br><br>
        “I do no such thing,” she said as if she was genuinely offended by his accusation.
        <br><br>
        “YOU DO! Like two hours ago you kept correcting me on my manner and shit! With all due respect, I don’t get a fuck about that, and I find it hard to believe you give a fuck about me.”
        <br><br>
        “I don’t. I care that someone of our ranks, a Moonlight Lord, is behaving in such a disgraceful manner,” she said. “I do not care about you, I do not care about your feelings, all I care about is making sure that you do your duty and behave in a manner that befits us.” 
        <br><br>
        “Bullshit, then why wait till now?” he pressed, folding his arms. “Just admit that you get off on pissing me off.” 
        <br><br>
        Obelac saw Laeticia’s eyes glint with rage as she stared daggers at him, yet he stood his ground. “Lower your tone. I am the only thing that’s keeping you as a Moonlight Lord to begin with.”
        <br><br>
        “And I’m trying to tell you that I’m getting fucking nothing from this! You’re treating me like I hate responsibilty, but fucking no one gave me any responsibility to begin with! For three fucking years no one did jack shit or fuck all to try and help me get used to my role. For three years you all just watched me and did nothing! This shit isn’t helping me! I don’t deny that vampires have their own agency, beliefs, and other shit. But that doesn’t change you from hating humans, does it?” 
        <br><br>
        “...it does not,” she conceded. “Then what? Are you saying you simply cannot change? Or that you refuse to?”
        <br><br>
        “NO! I’m saying you’re the last fucking person that could help!” he shouted. “You don’t give a shit about me, you only care about me like a fucking pet project. How can you help me if you don’t know anything about me?”
        <br><br>
        She looked at him for a moment, as if she pondered his words. “...You make a fair point,” she admitted, then headed off. Obelac rolled his eyes as he kicked the ground and caused a small crater. 
        <br><br>
        “Fucking bitch…”
        <br>

        <br><hr><br>

        <br>
        When Obelac returned home at three in the morning, he tried his best to not wake Chinatsu up, however that was for naught the moment he opened the door. He stepped inside and heard rustling from their bedroom, and then an exhausted groan. He supposed she’d be alert if someone entered her home at night, even if she didn’t deal with Curse Users. He made his way to the bedroom and without even turning on the lights he saw Chinatsu laying in the darkness. The blankets covered her entire top half and her hair was a mess. 
        <br><br>
        “Mmm…hurry up and get in bed…” she said groggily. Obelac chuckled to himself as he undressed a bit and got in. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close, and she’d settle into his embrace. It took a while for Obelac to fall to sleep, but when he did it was with a smile. 
        <br><br>
        When he woke up he was still holding Chinatsu in his arms. He was met with her still leaning into his embrace, yet she was facing him. She smiled. “Good morning.” 
        <br><br>
        “Good morning…” he said as he stared into her obsydian eyes. 
        <br><br>
        “How was it last night?”
        <br><br>
        “...ass,” he said simply. “You have any coworkers you hate?”
        <br><br>
        “Oh fuck yeah, I do,” she said with a light chuckle. “You gonna be ok?”
        <br><br>
        “I think so,” he said. He kept looking into her eyes. “I just don’t wanna do anything today.” 
        <br><br>
        “Well you’re lucky I don’t have any assignments…” she said. “We could just order some pizza and stay in all day. I wouldn’t mind that,” she told him. 
        <br><br>
        “Me neither…” he said. Obelac kept holding her in his arms as he basked in the warmth of her body against his. 
        <br><br>
        “I’ll get something for us,” she said as she slowly left his embrace. Obelac, for reasons he did not know, genuinely felt his heart sink at that. Chinatsu got up, and Obelac saw that she was wearing one of his shirts. He was used to the stereotypical scenario of a woman wearing her partner’s oversized shirt, yet Chinatsu seemed to wear it well enough. It was a black, short sleeve shirt. “Also make sure to brush your teeth, your breath stinks.” 
        <br><br>
        Obelac chuckled at that as he got up as well. As he headed to the bathroom, Chinatsu would head to the kitchen. The mirrors had been replaced by Cursed Tools that allowed him to see his reflection, and he took note of himself as he brushed his teeth. His hair had grown a lot, and he figured it was time for a haircut. He also needed to shave a little as well. He was never really able to grow a beard, and he didn’t want one either. He preferred to be clean shaven. Obelac washed his face after he was done brushing his teeth, and stretched his arms as he soon left. 
        <br><br>
        When he arrived in the kitchen, Obelac saw the leftover chicken they had the day before on the table, and that Chinatsu was already eating without him. He sat down across from her and began to eat as well, though it did nothing to quell his hunger. 
        <br><br>
        “Mmmm…we’re gonna have to get some more of this,” she said. “I never went to Lukas’ shop before this. Was it always this good?”
        <br><br>
        “Always,” Obelac said. “It never got me full, so I always just got a bunch and just…devoured it.” 
        <br><br>
        She laughed. “I don’t blame you. What’s even in this?”
        <br><br>
        “Thirteen secret herbs and spices, allegedly.” 
        <br><br>
        “I see…” she noted as she chomped down on a chicken leg.
        <br><br>
        As Obelac ate his mouth would start to get dry. He noticed that Chinatsu was almost done with her portion already. 
        <br><br>
        “You good?” she asked him. He nodded. 
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, yeah,” he said. “Just…kinda hungry is all…” 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu nodded at that. “Did you get them?”
        <br><br>
        “...get what?”
        <br><br>
        “You know what.”
        <br><br>
        He took a moment before he realized what she meant, then averted his gaze. “...I did.” 
        “Good boy,” she teased him. Obelac would’ve blushed if he was a few shades lighter. “We did it before without any, but I don’t wanna risk becoming a mom.” 
        <br><br>
        “No, yeah, I get it…” he said. Obelac recalled the look of absolute disgusted joy that the cashier, Robbie, gave him when he had bought them. The town of Brownsville wasn’t large and as such everyone knew eachother more or less. A byproduct of that was that everyone knew that Obelac and Chinatsu were dating, and when Obelac had bought a packet of contraceptives…word spread to his human friends. 
        <br><br>
        The Obelac from a few months ago wouldn’t have called the group of older men who forced him to fish and drink with them his friends, but he had realized he grew fond of them. 
        <br><br>
        “Why did you ask if I got them?” Obelac asked. 
        <br><br>
        “Because whenever you drink my blood, I always get in that mood,” she said. “And you do too.”
        <br><br>
        “Not my fault…” he weakly protested. Obelac thought back to the first time he drank Chinatsu’s blood, and the recollection of what happened after only made his heart thump fast in his chest. He got out of his seat and sat next to Chinatsu. The woman would crane her head for him as she smiled, and Obelac salivated at the sight of her neck. He leaned forward, wrapped his arms around her, and gently sunk his fangs into the flesh. 
        <br><br>
        A light gasp left her lips as he began to drink from her. He felt her warmth against his skin as he closed his eyes. He could hear her heart beating in her chest, and could hear her ragged breaths. Chinatsu placed her hand at the back of his head as she let him feed from her, and with every second that passed, he would feel his strength and vitality increase. He felt his desires surge, just as they had during the first time he fed from her, and the sweet nectar of her blood only made him want to drink and devour more. 
        <br><br>
        Moderation was never his thing. Obelac was never able to hold back on his urges, and when the most succulent meal was before him, he had the desire to eat and eat until his stomach burst open. 
        <br><br>
        Minutes passed as he kept drinking her blood, and he felt and heard her heart only quicken in its pace. At that moment he forgot about everything. Everything he hated and despised was replaced by the bliss of being with the woman he loved. He forgot about Laeticia, about the Moonlight Lords, about Nerd and every single thing outside that house. In that moment, none of that mattered in the slightest. The only thing that mattered was the woman he loved, the only thing other than his mother and brother. 
        <br><br>
        Those three he held above all else, most especially himself. 
        <br><br>
        Chinatsu slowly pulled his head away from her neck as she gasped for air, and the bite marks on her neck would heal as her blood stained his black shirt. He didn’t mind that at all. 
        Obelac looked at Chinatsu as he caught his breath. She looked him on the eyes, and placed her finger on his lips. He blinked in confusion, and he saw as she swiped some blood from him and licked it. “...doesn’t taste special,” she said casually. 
        <br><br>
        That simple remakrd made Obelac want to show her how special she was, down to the last atom of her being. The two looked at eachother, and he felt so many desires that fought for supremacy. He wanted to hold her. He wanted to kiss her. He wanted to feel her skin against his own. He wanted to make her feel bliss, and he wanted to feel bliss.

        Chinatsu took hold of his hand as she led him to the living room. 
        “What about the con-”
        <br><br>
        “-It’s in my shadow, I’ll get it,  just sit your ass down on the couch.” 
        Her forcefulness took him by surprise, but he complied. She smiled. 
        “Good boy.”

        Obelac leaned into Chinatsu as they watched a movie on the couch as they ate pizza. He had received a call from Laeticia earlier, but he had ignored it. He was simply content with being with the woman he loved. Her arm was wrapped around him, and they had a blanket covered over them both as they watched <i>Aliens</i>. Obelac had never seen it before, as Brunestud forbade him from watching horror movies when she was raising him, and Chinatsu insisted that he did. 
        <br><br>
        As they laid with eachother, Obelac rested his head against her shoulder. “Love you…” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. 
        <br><br>
        “Love you too,” she said softly, her voice like honey to his ears. As they relaxed with eachother, Obelac wondered about what she had said. He understood what it meant, but the reasoning behind it was an enigma to him. 
        <br><br>
        How could she love someone as broken and worthless as he was?
